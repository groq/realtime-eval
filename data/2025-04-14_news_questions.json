    "content": "Millions watch as underwater camera documents daily life on a Miami coral reef\n\nYouTube\n\nMIAMI \u2014 For five years and counting, a continuous livestream on YouTube has shown daily life in a community few people get a chance to visit \u2014 a coral reef in Biscayne Bay.\n\nThe Coral City Camera shows endangered corals that are thriving and remarkably resilient in the heart of Miami's busy port. The live feed has helped scientists gain a new understanding of the value and beauty of something they call \"urban corals.\"\n\nThe underwater camera is the brainchild of Colin Foord. He's a marine biologist who, while he was still in high school, became intrigued by corals. They're the tiny marine animals that build large, stony colonies, creating diverse and colorful underwater ecosystems.\n\nFive years ago, Foord installed a video camera on corals living in a busy channel in Miami's port. Since then, the live feed of corals and fish has been viewed more than 3.7 million times. He says, \"We've got close to 20 different species of stony corals living in one of the busiest ports in the entire world.\"\n\ntoggle caption Greg Allen/NPR\n\nFoord spends time each week maintaining the camera, which he accesses from a spit of land in the port. To get there, he drives past cruise terminals and huge gantry cranes unloading container ships.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHe arrives at a spot, just across the channel from Miami Beach that's remarkably peaceful. Just offshore, in abot nine feet of water is his video camera. Gazing across the bay, he says, \"You can see, the water is really gorgeous. It's turquoise blue. And we're standing on this limestone rip rap.\"\n\nRip rap are large pieces of rock that armor a shoreline, protecting it from erosion, storm surge and sea level rise.\n\n\"These boulders go down into the water,\" he says. \"They provide great habitat for fish and for corals to recruit onto the limestone. It's geologically basically the same as coral skeletons so corals are happy to grow on it.\" Huge cruise ships and recreational boaters pass by just 150 feet away.\n\nFoord operates the Coral City Camera from a warehouse and lab several miles inland from the port in a warehouse where he has at least 50 saltwater tanks and nearly a thousand species of coral. He hopes to eventually expand his \"coral museum\" and open it to the public. Using a computer, Foord controls the video camera, changing its angles several times a day. He calls the live feed a \"free-range aquarium.\"\n\ntoggle caption Greg Allen/NPR\n\nVolunteer moderators contribute to the chat on the feed, alerting viewers to sightings of squid and manatees. He says repeat viewers begin to notice some of what he calls \"the regulars.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We have Lisa, the lemon shark who has this Mona Lisa smile,\" he says. \"You begin to recognize that they really do live here. It's their neighborhood.\"\n\nAlmost 20 years ago, Foord helped start Coral Morphologic, a company that blends his interest in corals with art. He's been involved in a number of projects, including one during Miami's Art Basel fair a few years ago that projected images of coral onto the city's performing arts center. He says, \"We approach corals from a slightly different perspective than the academic or scientific community might. Our goal really is to try and reach the public and get them to really fall in love with these organisms that are just so alien, that how can you not be captivated by them?\"\n\nThe Coral City Camera has begun to show not just the beauty, but also the resilience of these \"urban corals,\" corals that persist and sometimes thrive in port cities like Miami, Singapore and Sydney.\n\nFoord says that was demonstrated dramatically two years ago when record-high ocean temperatures caused corals around the world to bleach and, in many cases, die. \"2023 was an absolutely dreadful year,\" he says. \"We watched corals all up and down the Florida reef tract bleaching and dying. And yet for the most part, the corals living at the port of Miami around the Coral City camera didn't even bleach.\"\n\nUsing daily screenshots from his video feed, Foord compiled what he believes is the world's longest-running underwater time lapse video feed documenting the bleaching event. It shows the death of some corals over several months and the resiliency and regrowth of others.\n\nIn part because of Foord's work, NOAA research ecologist Ian Enochs is studying Miami's urban corals and has published some surprising findings. He says, \"They may be genetically stronger, more capable of dealing with environmental conditions that are otherwise killing corals.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nClimate change, ocean acidification and pollution are degrading coral reefs worldwide. In Florida, NOAA and a host of research groups are working to restore the ailing reefs. Enochs says these urban corals may play a key role in that effort. He says, \"If we can find individuals that are able to deal with these environmental stressors, if we can grow them, if we can outplant them, then we can build reefs that are more resilient.\"\n\nTo help make that happen, Coral Morphologic is building a lab to breed and cultivate urban coral species. It's a high-tech endeavor, with continuously controlled water quality and specially designed LED lights. Foord says, \"We can simulate the solar and lunar cycles to induce these urban corals to spawn.\" The plan, he says, is \"They can pass on their resilient genes to produce hardy babies that we're then going to bring out to the reef line to plant to other places in Miami.\"\n\ntoggle caption Greg Allen/NPR\n\nIt's one of a number of projects Foord has in the works. This summer working with other artists and scientists, he'll begin planting corals on an artificial reef that's planned to be seven miles long and within swimming distance of Miami Beach."

Before acquiring Instagram in 2012, Zuckerberg wrote in an internal email that he sought to \"neutralize a potential competitor.\" And ahead of Meta purchasing WhatsApp, in 2014, Zuckerberg wrote an email saying the messaging service represents \"a big risk for us.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn court, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson said these messages illustrate Meta's motivation: that it used its size and influence to crush alternative services.\n\n\"They decided that competition was too hard,\" Matheson said in his opening statement. \"And it would be easier to buy out their rivals rather than compete with them.\"\n\nThe result, Matheson argued, has been lower-quality social media apps for consumers, as Meta prioritizes preserving its power and boosting its profits above all else.\n\nMeta's lawyer, Mark Hansen, offered the judge a far different perspective. He said the company purchased Instagram and WhatsApp \"to improve and grow them.\"\n\nHansen argued that Meta is not a monopoly because it has never raised prices on consumers, noting all of its major apps are free \u2014 and that is because rival apps also do not charge. If a company were to charge, its app would lose customers, driving down the amount of time people spend on their platform. \"The average American uses more than 40 apps every month,\" Hansen said. \"An app that loses minutes \u2026 potentially loses advertising revenue as well.\"\n\nThe quality of Meta's apps \"has improved on every objective measure,\" he said, pointing out Meta's user growth over the years. People use more of something when it becomes better, he said: \"That's economics 101.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHansen argued that the FTC's case involves the \"incoherent parsing of competition\" to make the case that Meta is dominant, when it is merely vying for people's attention in a crowded online world.\n\nA case that stretches back to 2020\n\nThe broad strokes of these arguments have been outlined by lawyers in pretrial motions over the last 4 1/2 years, but on Monday, they were made before U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who will be presiding over the trial in Washington, D.C., for the next eight weeks.\n\nThe case, which was filed during Trump's first term, is considered the most serious legal threat Meta has ever faced. If the FTC prevails, Meta could be forced to break up its $1.3 trillion advertising business. Experts say having to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp into separate companies could hamper Meta, since user data and advertising systems are integrated across its service.\n\nGovernment lawyers plan to call a parade of witnesses, including former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, to show Meta has broken U.S. competition laws in amassing its social media empire.\n\nThe trial is expected to involve vigorous debates about technical details. The Federal Trade Commission previewed that on Monday. Attorneys for the agency said that Meta controls 78% of a market it has defined as \"personal social networks\" by total monthly users.\n\nThis argument is rejected by Meta, which points out the popularity of competing services like TikTok, YouTube and X. Meta says the government has \"gerrymandered\" a market to exaggerate Meta's influence. Viewed by how much time people spend on apps, Meta's market share of social media is around 30%, the company maintains.\n\nLegal experts say the outcome of the case could hinge on how the judge views these definitions.\n\nIt is the third time in recent years the federal government has hauled a Big Tech company to court seeking to split up parts of a Silicon Valley business.\n\nThe Department of Justice has asked that Google be forced to sell off its popular Chrome browser. A phase of that trial focused on how Google must change its business to comply with competitive law is scheduled for April. And there is a second case pending against Google in which the government alleges that the company illegally monopolizes the market for online ads.\n\nTaken together, the legal actions against the tech companies underscore growing public and political backlash against the business practices of Silicon Valley, a skepticism that was magnified when tech critic Lina Khan headed the FTC during the Biden administration. But even Republicans, and many top Trump officials, believe the tech industry power should be reined in.\n\nIn recent months, Meta's Zuckerberg \u2014 whom Trump once threatened to imprison \u2014 has been ingratiating himself with Trump. Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund. The company paid Trump $25 million to settle a lawsuit over his social media account suspensions in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. And Meta has made company changes that align with Trump's priorities, including ending a fact-checking program and rolling back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nSuch moves have led to a debate in Washington about whether Trump would order the FTC to settle the case.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAndrew Ferguson, Trump's pick who now heads the agency, has brushed aside speculation that the case would be dropped, telling Bloomberg last month: \"We don't intend to take our foot off the gas.\""

    "content": "Meta and the FTC face off in court over monopoly claims\n\ntoggle caption Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission told a federal judge on Monday that Meta has abused its power and acted as a monopoly by acquiring rivals instead of competing fairly, opening a months-long trial seen as a test of the Trump administration's ability to challenge the power of Silicon Valley.\n\nTo make its case, the FTC cited Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's own words. Before acquiring Instagram in 2012, Zuckerberg wrote in an internal email that he sought to \"neutralize a potential competitor.\" And ahead of Meta purchasing WhatsApp, in 2014, Zuckerberg wrote an email saying the messaging service represents \"a big risk for us.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn court, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson said these messages illustrate Meta's motivation: that it used its size and influence to crush alternative services.\n\n\"They decided that competition was too hard,\" Matheson said in his opening statement. \"And it would be easier to buy out their rivals rather than compete with them.\"\n\nThe result, Matheson argued, has been lower-quality social media apps for consumers, as Meta prioritizes preserving its power and boosting its profits above all else.\n\nMeta's lawyer, Mark Hansen, offered the judge a far different perspective. He said the company purchased Instagram and WhatsApp \"to improve and grow them.\"\n\nHansen argued that Meta is not a monopoly because it has never raised prices on consumers, noting all of its major apps are free \u2014 and that is because rival apps also do not charge. If a company were to charge, its app would lose customers, driving down the amount of time people spend on their platform. \"The average American uses more than 40 apps every month,\" Hansen said. \"An app that loses minutes \u2026 potentially loses advertising revenue as well.\"\n\nThe quality of Meta's apps \"has improved on every objective measure,\" he said, pointing out Meta's user growth over the years. People use more of something when it becomes better, he said: \"That's economics 101.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHansen argued that the FTC's case involves the \"incoherent parsing of competition\" to make the case that Meta is dominant, when it is merely vying for people's attention in a crowded online world.\n\nA case that stretches back to 2020\n\nThe broad strokes of these arguments have been outlined by lawyers in pretrial motions over the last 4 1/2 years, but on Monday, they were made before U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who will be presiding over the trial in Washington, D.C., for the next eight weeks.\n\nThe case, which was filed during Trump's first term, is considered the most serious legal threat Meta has ever faced.

Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, in a statement.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOver the last decade, as more states expanded Medicaid coverage under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, the program emerged as the leading source of insurance coverage for high quality addiction treatment in the U.S.\n\nA study released in February by the Brookings Institution, a centrist think-tank that focuses extensively on drug policy issues, found nearly 90 percent of medical treatment for opioid and fentanyl addiction in the U.S. is paid for at least in part through Medicaid.\n\nMost drug policy experts say that funding helped reduce drug overdose deaths, which plunged 26.6 percent nationwide from June 2023 to October 2024, according to the latest provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBut the Affordable Care Act remains a target for many GOP lawmakers, who view the Obama-era program with suspicion. While it's not yet clear how Republican budget proposals will impact Medicaid and its role in drug treatment, House GOP leaders have floated ideas that include slashing as much as $2.3 trillion from the program over the next decade.\n\ntoggle caption Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Imag/CQ-Roll Call, Inc.\n\nSpeaking over the weekend with Fox News, House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested young men, who are highly vulnerable to drug addiction and account for the vast majority of U.S. overdose deaths, should not qualify for Medicaid insurance.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We have to eliminate people for example on Medicaid who are not eligible to be there, able-bodied workers, for example, young men, who should never be on the program at all,\" Johnson said.\n\nResearch shows men are two to three times more likely to die from drug deaths, compared with women; and fentanyl is now a leading cause of death for men under the age of fifty.\n\nA growing number of addiction researchers, doctors and people who survived drug addiction have raised alarm deep Medicaid cuts could derail the national recovery from the fentanyl-overdose epidemic.\n\n\"It's very hard to look at the budget framework created by Republicans and imagine a scenario other than Medicaid being cut severely,\" said Stanford University's Keith Humphreys speaking with NPR last month. \"It's a frightening prospect. That will be extremely painful for families facing addiction.\"\n\nIn a statement, Dr. Brian Hurley, head of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, urged lawmakers to protect Medicaid expansion for Americans facing addiction.\n\n\"It not only helps states pay for evidence-based addiction treatment...but it also undermines the drug cartels' business model by reducing demand for illicit opioids,\" Hurley said.\n\nThe Brookings Institution report concluded that a major rollback of Medicaid expansion could drastically reduce addiction care nationwide.\n\n\"Since Medicaid payments for treatment of OUD [opioid use disorder] dwarfs all other public sources of funding for OUD care, significant reductions would substantially reduce the nation's economic commitment to addressing the opioid epidemic,\" the Brookings report found."

Other big names include journalist Gayle King and Bezos' fianc\u00e9, Lauren S\u00e1nchez.\n\nThe star-studded crew flew on Blue Origin's New Shepard launch vehicle, which since 2021 has ferried dozens of scientists, entrepreneurs and celebrities above the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, the internationally recognized boundary of space, about 62 miles above Earth's surface.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMonday's mission, NS-31, had garnered considerable attention in recent weeks because of its famous passengers and historic nature.\n\nIt was the first all-female spaceflight since 1963, when Soviet-era cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova \u2014 the first woman in space \u2014 orbited the Earth during a nearly three-day solo flight.\n\nBlue Origin's flight was significantly shorter, lasting 10 minutes and 21 seconds.\n\nIt took off from Blue Origin's Launch Site One in West Texas at 9:30 a.m. EDT on Monday, after weeks of anticipation.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people tuned into Blue Origin's online livestream to watch the journey from launch to landing, as passengers' loved ones \u2014 many of them celebrities in their own right, such as Oprah Winfrey \u2014 watched in person.\n\nThe crew spent several minutes in zero gravity and total amazement, as captured by audio on the livestream. They could be heard marveling at the moon and, later, screaming excitedly when the parachutes opened on the way down.\n\n\"Congratulations, and welcome back to Earth,\" mission control said as the capsule settled in the dusty valley.\n\nMinutes later, the door to the capsule opened and all six women filed out, some crying and pumping their fists. Both Perry and King knelt down to touch the ground with their own hands.\n\n\"It's oddly quiet when you get up there,\" King said later. \"It's really quiet and peaceful, and you look down on the planet and think: That's where we came from? To me it's such a reminder about how we need to do better, be better.\"\n\nKing also revealed that Perry \u2014 who had hinted that she might sing on board \u2014 entertained her crewmates with parts of Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\" while the capsule floated in space.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I think that it's not about me, it's not about singing my songs, it's about a collective energy in there,\" Perry said afterward. \"It's about making space for future women, and taking up space and belonging, and it's about this wonderful world that we see right out there and appreciating it. This is all for the benefit of Earth.\"\n\nHere's what else to know about the flight and the people on board.\n\n\n\nWho was aboard \u2014 and how did they react?\n\nThe fully autonomous vehicle had no pilots, and six crew members:\n\nLauren S\u00e1nchez, a journalist, author, pilot and philanthropist who also happens to be Bezos' fianc\u00e9. She is credited with putting the team together and working with the brand Monse to redesign the women's space suits.\n\nSanchez was visibly emotional after exiting the capsule, saying she didn't have the words to describe her experience.

    "content": "Katy Perry, Gayle King and others reflect on their brief but historic trip to space\n\ntoggle caption Justin Hamel/Getty Images\n\nAfter returning from a brief trip to space, Katy Perry says she will definitely be writing a song about her experience.\n\nPerry was one of six in an all-female crew that launched and landed safely on Monday morning aboard a rocket operated by Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin company. Other big names include journalist Gayle King and Bezos' fianc\u00e9, Lauren S\u00e1nchez.\n\nThe star-studded crew flew on Blue Origin's New Shepard launch vehicle, which since 2021 has ferried dozens of scientists, entrepreneurs and celebrities above the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, the internationally recognized boundary of space, about 62 miles above Earth's surface.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMonday's mission, NS-31, had garnered considerable attention in recent weeks because of its famous passengers and historic nature.\n\nIt was the first all-female spaceflight since 1963, when Soviet-era cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova \u2014 the first woman in space \u2014 orbited the Earth during a nearly three-day solo flight.\n\nBlue Origin's flight was significantly shorter, lasting 10 minutes and 21 seconds.\n\nIt took off from Blue Origin's Launch Site One in West Texas at 9:30 a.m. EDT on Monday, after weeks of anticipation.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people tuned into Blue Origin's online livestream to watch the journey from launch to landing, as passengers' loved ones \u2014 many of them celebrities in their own right, such as Oprah Winfrey \u2014 watched in person.\n\nThe crew spent several minutes in zero gravity and total amazement, as captured by audio on the livestream. They could be heard marveling at the moon and, later, screaming excitedly when the parachutes opened on the way down.\n\n\"Congratulations, and welcome back to Earth,\" mission control said as the capsule settled in the dusty valley.\n\nMinutes later, the door to the capsule opened and all six women filed out, some crying and pumping their fists. Both Perry and King knelt down to touch the ground with their own hands.\n\n\"It's oddly quiet when you get up there,\" King said later. \"It's really quiet and peaceful, and you look down on the planet and think: That's where we came from? To me it's such a reminder about how we need to do better, be better.\"\n\nKing also revealed that Perry \u2014 who had hinted that she might sing on board \u2014 entertained her crewmates with parts of Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\" while the capsule floated in space.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I think that it's not about me, it's not about singing my songs, it's about a collective energy in there,\" Perry said afterward. \"It's about making space for future women, and taking up space and belonging, and it's about this wonderful world that we see right out there and appreciating it. This is all for the benefit of Earth.\"\n\nHere's what else to know about the flight and the people on board.\n\n\n\nWho was aboard \u2014 and how did they react?\n\nThe fully autonomous vehicle had no pilots, and six crew members:\n\nLauren S\u00e1nchez, a journalist, author, pilot and philanthropist who also happens to be Bezos' fianc\u00e9. She is credited with putting the team together and working with the brand Monse to redesign the women's space suits.\n\nSanchez was visibly emotional after exiting the capsule, saying she didn't have the words to describe her experience. She reflected on how \"quiet\" but \"really alive\" the Earth looked, saying it made her think about how \"we're all in this together.\"\n\nShe also joked that if Bezos didn't want to marry her, he didn't have to send her into space.

The four-year agreement includes pay hikes, hiring more teachers and class size limits.\n\nWhile negotiations between the Chicago Teachers Union and the district didn\u2019t escalate this time, there was unprecedented turmoil surrounding the unusual yearlong talks. The drama included the school superintendent\u2019s firing, the entire board resigning and historic elections that tested the union\u2019s power.\n\nNow, Chicago faces uncertainty with Trump administration education cuts and looming questions about how the nation\u2019s fourth-largest school district will pay for the contract.\n\nWhile all parties are celebrating the agreement now, there\u2019s been no shortage of turbulence.\n\nPerhaps the main reason negotiations didn\u2019t devolve into a strike, as was the case in 2019 and 2012, was union ally Mayor Brandon Johnson. A former teacher and CTU organizer, the union helped elect him in 2023.\n\nHe spent months trying to oust Chicago Public Schools CEO Pedro Martinez, an appointee of former Mayor Lori Lightfoot, in a public spat.\n\n\u201cAll of that chaos and turmoil there clearly dragged down the bargaining and probably shut it down for a fair amount of time,\u201d said Robert Bruno, a University of Illinois professor of labor and employment relations.\n\nJohnson wanted a $300 million high-interest loan to cover the new contract and a pension payment, which Martinez and the board rejected as fiscally irresponsible. In October, the board resigned in protest.\n\nThe next month, the city held its first school elections. The transitional board \u2014 a mix of union-backed candidates, charter school supporters and independents \u2014 includes mayoral appointees until it\u2019s fully elected in 2027.\n\nIn December, the board moved to fire Martinez, though he\u2019ll remain until June. At one point, Martinez accused new members of meeting privately with the union and won a judge\u2019s restraining order.\n\nThe union started contract talks last year with more than 700 requests, a record for the almost 30,000-member union.\n\nUnion leaders say their goal is always equality in the segregated city. Roughly 70% of the 325,000 students in the district are low-income and more than 80% are Black or Latino.\n\nBut district officials said those lofty requests would have cost over $10 billion. The district\u2019s annual budget is roughly $10 billion.\n\nThe new agreement\u2019s price tag is about $1.5 billion.\n\n\u201cWe stayed true to our values,\u201d Martinez said after the deal was announced. \u201cWe succeeded in keeping the best interest of our students always at the center.\"\n\nBoth sides touted transparency. For the first time, some bargaining sessions were publicly livestreamed.\n\nIt was also the first time in nearly about decades the union was allowed to bargain on issues like class size. In 1995, a Republican-led Illinois legislature passed a law limiting collective bargaining rights largely to pay and benefits. Democratic leaders changed that in 2021.\n\nCTU President Stacy Davis Gates celebrated the contract as a win that protects students, particularly those who are vulnerable under Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s big, it\u2019s complex and it is certainly a step in the right direction,\u201d she said.\n\nJohnson also took a victory lap, trumpeting his union ties.\n\n\u201cWhen I was running for office, they said it would be a liability,\u201d he told reporters recently. \u201cBut it sounds like to me that no other mayor could have brought Chicago Public Schools, the Board of Education, the mayor\u2019s office and the CTU together to the table to make sure that our children get exactly what they deserve, which is a fully funded, well-rounded education.\u201d\n\nUnder the deal, teachers will get 4% retroactive raises as the contract expired last year. Then they\u2019ll get 4% or 5% raises each year after.\n\nStarting next year, the median teacher pay will be $98,000. By the contract\u2019s end in 2028, the average teacher will earn around $110,000, according to the district.\n\nThe district, which employs roughly 7,000 teachers, will hire 800 more, and nearly 100 additional librarians. Teachers will get an extra 10 minutes of daily prep time, for 70 minutes total.\n\nAlso, class sizes will be limited by grade level. For instance, kindergarten will have the smallest and be capped at 25 students.\n\nUnion leaders announced Monday that 97% of members who voted approved the deal. Davis Gates called it \u201coverwhelmingly historic levels\u201d of support for a contract that built on previous years' work, including strikes.\n\nExperts say what happened in Chicago could give other unions momentum. Los Angeles teachers, who are currently negotiating, noted CTU in a recent newsletter.\n\n\u201cOrganizing is how we resist political agendas to dismantle our public schools and public services. And we can Win Our Future in Los Angeles, just like our union siblings in Chicago,\u201d the United Teachers Los Angeles newsletter read.\n\nStill, serious funding questions remain.\n\nThe district has a roughly $500 million annual deficit and a pending $175 million pension reimbursement to the city. The district is also about to enter contract negotiations with the principals\u2019 union.\n\nMartinez said the first year of the contract is covered, but there\u2019s uncertainty after that.\n\nWhere the two sides agree is that the talks took too long.\n\nAs Trump took office, union organizers said there was more gravity to their work, even as both sides in the Democratic stronghold are aligned on issues including immigrant rights.\n\n\u201cWe had a sense of urgency, we had a sense of responsibility,\u201d Davis Gates said. \u201cThe district shared the responsibility, but not the urgency.\u201d\n\nSchool officials accused the union of taking their time.\n\n\u201cWe should have had this contract months ago,\u201d Martinez said."

The four-year agreement includes pay hikes, hiring more teachers and class size limits.\n\nWhile negotiations between the Chicago Teachers Union and the district didn\u2019t escalate this time, there was unprecedented turmoil surrounding the unusual yearlong talks. The drama included the school superintendent\u2019s firing, the entire board resigning and historic elections that tested the union\u2019s power.\n\nNow, Chicago faces uncertainty with Trump administration education cuts and looming questions about how the nation\u2019s fourth-largest school district will pay for the contract.\n\nWhile all parties are celebrating the agreement now, there\u2019s been no shortage of turbulence.\n\nPerhaps the main reason negotiations didn\u2019t devolve into a strike, as was the case in 2019 and 2012, was union ally Mayor Brandon Johnson. A former teacher and CTU organizer, the union helped elect him in 2023.\n\nHe spent months trying to oust Chicago Public Schools CEO Pedro Martinez, an appointee of former Mayor Lori Lightfoot, in a public spat.\n\n\u201cAll of that chaos and turmoil there clearly dragged down the bargaining and probably shut it down for a fair amount of time,\u201d said Robert Bruno, a University of Illinois professor of labor and employment relations.\n\nJohnson wanted a $300 million high-interest loan to cover the new contract and a pension payment, which Martinez and the board rejected as fiscally irresponsible.

The team has proposed a private-public partnership to which the state would contribute $600 million.\n\nAfter the money was approved by the Ohio House last week, commissioners in Hamilton County, home to the Bengals, balked. They moved swiftly to re-up their request for $350 million for Paycor Stadium, where the Bengals' lease is up June 30, 2026.

The existing $247 million Huntington Bank Field was primarily funded by city and county tax dollars. To many, it's a symbol of the hard-luck sports town's commitment to the team it nearly lost when then-owner Art Modell notoriously packed off to Baltimore in 1996.\n\nModell's messy exit, also hitched to a stadium dispute, led to a state law that says no owner of an Ohio professional sports team that plays most of its home games at a tax-supported stadium can go elsewhere without an agreement with its host city or unless the host city is given six months\u2019 notice with an opportunity to buy the team.\n\nDemocratic Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb and members of the city council have threatened for months to invoke the \u201cModell Law\u201d to prevent the Browns from leaving their current location, where the lease runs through the 2028 season. The city plans to remake the so-called \u201cNorth Shore\u201d with an eye toward accessibility, economic development and environmental protection.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nPresident Donald Trump talks to reporters as he walks on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Sunday, April 13, 2025. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Senate, once again, was working into the early morning hours Friday with its new majority leader, Republican John Thune, setting the pace.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until just after 2 a.m. that the last of the senators had straggled into the chamber to cast their vote on the confirmation of retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan \u201cRazin\u201d Caine for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The vote capped a grinding start to the year for the Senate that included several all-night floor sessions and \u2014 importantly for Thune \u2014 the quickest top-level Cabinet confirmation process in the past 20 years.\n\nAt the outset, however, such an outcome was far from assured. President Donald Trump was making demands that the new Senate leader be ready to put the chamber into recess so he could skip over the Senate confirmation process altogether. Faced with that prospect, Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said his message in conversations with the president was, \u201cLet us do this the old-fashioned way and just use the clock and grind it out, and then we\u2019ll see where we go from there.\u201d\n\nThat approach has been successful allowing Thune to show Trump the Senate\u2019s worth while also preserving its constitutional role in installing a president\u2019s Cabinet. But the decision to push forward on even Trump's most unconventional Cabinet nominees has also come at a cost.\n\nSeveral Cabinet officials have been intimately involved in the early controversies of Trump\u2019s second term, from discussing military plans on an unclassified Signal app chat to encouraging the Republican president to follow through with steep tariffs on trading partners.\n\nGOP senators, many of whom still hold traditional Republican ideas, have often had to mount a response. The Republican chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, last month initiated an investigation by the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general into whether classified information was shared on Signal by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. And GOP senators more recently made a concerted effort to encourage Trump to negotiate trade deals with other nations rather than listen to advisers like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who was adamant that tariffs were there to stay.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press shortly after Trump announced a pause on tariffs to most nations, Thune said the announcement showed the president is \u201cresponding to the feedback he\u2019s given.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think everybody wants to see him succeed with this, wants to see the country succeed and wants to make sure that we\u2019re gauging and calibrating \u2014 as some of these major policy shifts are being made \u2014 the impacts that they have,\u201d Thune added.\n\nThat balance \u2014 Thune's supportive yet still cautious approach \u2014 has marked his early months working with a president with whom, until last year, he had a fraught relationship. So far, Trump and Thune have stayed on upbeat terms, but the stakes will only rise for Republicans in the coming months as they try to lift through Congress a massive package of tax breaks and spending cuts on party-line votes.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, it took barely a year \u2014 and some setbacks in Congress \u2014 before Trump began openly feuding with then Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nDiscussing the reconciliation package as he sat in McConnell\u2019s old leadership office, Thune stressed that for the GOP\u2019s marquee legislation to work, \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to be rolling in the same direction. It takes a lot of teamwork.\u201d\n\nAs Trump has entered office with practically total command of the Republican Party and an agenda to upend the federal government and its role in society, Thune acknowledged that Trump has been aggressive in his use of executive power. But he argued that it was no different from how previous presidents wanted to \u201ctake as much power as they possibly can,\" pointing to President Joe Biden\u2019s moves to cancel student debt and boost government food assistance.\n\n\u201cOur job is to do what we can to support the president and his agenda,\u201d Thune said. \u201cBut, you know, be that important check and balance, too, that the Founders intended.\u201d\n\nStill, as Trump has blazed through constitutional norms with sweeping orders that endanger civil rights, government programs, the federal workforce and America\u2019s relationship with allies, Republicans in Congress have stood by.\n\n\u201cWe need Republicans to get off the sidelines, including the majority leader, and say, \u2019This is unacceptable behavior by any president,'\u201d said Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat.\n\nKelly cited Trump\u2019s disparagement of NATO and comments about taking over countries like Canada and Greenland and the Panama Canal. \u201cThe damage that Donald Trump is doing to our international reputation is not something we easily recover from,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Kelly added that Thune \u201cdeserves some credit\u201d for making the \u201cmechanics of the Senate function well.\u201d\n\nThune has been aggressive in trying to get the Senate to move faster through its votes. He noted that he had allowed one recent vote session to close before he had even had a chance to cast his vote because he was at the White House for a meeting.\n\nIt\u2019s an incremental change in the Senate\u2019s timing, but one that Thune, a former runner, hopes will contribute to the chamber becoming more active and deliberative in shaping the law. He won the leadership contest in part by pledging to allow individual senators to have more of a say in crafting and amending legislation.\n\nSo far, the Senate has also gained bipartisan support to pass bills that will increase prison penalties for fentanyl traffickers as well as mandate the detainment of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally and are accused of theft and violent crimes.\n\nSen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican who has been vocal about changes to the way legislation advances, said Thune has \"done a great job,\" although the Senate hasn't had much of a chance to work on legislation.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter,\" he added, \u201cis we've been consumed by confirmations.\u201d"

That update is expected to include the State Department\u2019s latest estimates of voluntary retirements and separations and how those will affect potential future layoffs to meet benchmarks from Elon Musk's DOGE and the government's human resources agency, according to officials familiar with the process.\n\nIn an unexpected move, Pete Marocco, a Trump administration political appointee who oversaw the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, has left the State Department, the officials said. He had moved to State as the director of foreign assistance in March after the remaining USAID programs were shifted under the department.\n\nDepartment spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters at the time that Marocco was filling \u201can indispensable role in aligning all U.S. government foreign assistance with the president\u2019s priorities.\u201d\n\nBut in confirming Marocco\u2019s departure on Sunday, the officials said Marocco left after completing the job he was brought on board to do, which was to dismantle USAID.\n\nThe update to be presented Monday also is expected to add clarity to plans to fold any surviving USAID programs into the department.\n\nBut these officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters, said the update to the White House Office of Personnel Management would not be the final word on the reorganization of the State Department. And, they denied speculation among the rank and file that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had refused to sign off on the document.\n\nWhile foreign and civil service employees await word on their futures, the State Department has moved ahead with an initiative aimed at rooting out religious bias in its policies and hiring practices with a specific emphasis on anti-Christian activity that may have occurred under President Joe Biden.\n\nThere is no immediate indication that such discrimination, as defined by President Donald Trump\u2019s State Department, took place under Biden.\n\nIn a cable sent Friday to all U.S. diplomatic missions, Rubio asked that staffers report any perceived discriminatory actions taken against Christians or employees advocating on their behalf between January 2021 and January 2025. The cable, copies of which were obtained by The Associated Press, says that all reported allegations will be investigated by a government-wide task force on anti-Christian bias and if discrimination is found the culprits may be disciplined. It also makes clear that allegations can be submitted anonymously.\n\n\u201cThe task force will collect information and ideas from individuals and groups, including Department employees, affected by anti-Christian bias or other religious discriminatory conduct,\u201d the cable says.\n\n\u201cThe task force is soliciting examples of anti-religious bias, particularly from the past four years, where the Department targeted anyone for their religion, including discrimination, harassment, exclusion, disciplinary action, adverse security clearance determinations, or any other adverse action, or in retaliation for exercising their religious rights,\u201d the cable said. \u201cThis includes anti-religious bias committed by department employees in their official duties against members of the public.\u201d\n\nExamples of potential violations include formal or informal actions taken against a person because they requested religious accommodation \u201cfrom taking mandatory vaccines or observing religious holidays \u201d and \u201cmistreatment for refusing to participate in events and activities that promoted themes inconsistent with or hostile to one\u2019s religious beliefs, including policies or practices related to preferred personal pronouns,\u201d according to the cable.\n\nOthers include \u201cmistreatment for opposing displays of flags, banners or other paraphernalia on or in government facilities because of religious objection or for opposing official media content due to religious objections, forcing employees to remove personal displays of religious faith or conscience, whether as part of clothing/accessories items on desks or in personal workspace,\u201d the cable said.\n\nIn non-governmental chat groups and elsewhere, some State Department employees expressed alarm over the cable, particularly as it was issued shortly after the promotion of a junior foreign service officer to temporarily run the department\u2019s human resources office, the Bureau of Global Talent Management.\n\nLew Olowski assumed that job last week and in his first comments to employees gave a welcome address to a new class of incoming diplomats that cited both biblical verses and religiously themed quotes from President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAfter swearing in the new class with the oath to Constitution, Olowski told them: \u201cOaths and words are different. Words are for talking. Dolphins can talk. Oaths are covenants. Animals do not covenant. Only God and man can make covenants.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo an officer of the United States like you and me, the Constitution is our commandment. Its words are like the word of God and the words of the oath are our creation as officers,\u201d he said, according to a transcript of his remarks.\n\n\u201cAnd these words are our beginning. In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God,\u201d he said, before praising foreign service officers who have died while in service to the country.\n\nIn a perhaps unusual coincidence, reports of anti-Christian or other religious bias are to be reported to Olowski\u2019s wife, Heather, who is the head of the State Department\u2019s office of civil rights.\n\nLast week, the American Foreign Service Association, which represents U.S. diplomats, and the American Academy of Diplomacy said Olowski's appointment was an affront to the long-held standard that the post be occupied by either a current senior or retired career diplomat. His numerous pro-Trump and anti-immigrant writings in conservative publications over the past several years had been been widely shared among internal group chats.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sam Mednick in Jerusalem contributed to this report."

The boat's crew is trying out pop-up gear aimed at preventing whale entanglements. (AP Photo/Emily Steinberger)\n\nAfter years of a shortened crab fishing season aimed at preventing whale entanglements off the West Coast, California crabbers are experimenting with a new fishing method that allows them to stay on the water longer while keeping the marine mammals safe.\n\nThe state has been running a pilot program since 2023 to try out so-called pop-up gear to protect whales while finding a solution to fishermen's woes and is expected to fully authorize the gear for spring Dungeness crab fishing in 2026.\n\nThe gear, which uses a remote device to pull up lines laid horizontally across the sea floor, also is being tried on lobster in Maine, black sea bass in Georgia and fisheries in Australia and Canada.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it has been six years we've been delayed or closed early for whales,\u201d said Brand Little, a San Francisco Dungeness crab fisherman who is among those participating in the pilot.\n\n\"This is a way to get our industry back,\" he said.\n\nThe effort comes after reports of whale entanglements off the Pacific Coast spiked a decade ago during a marine heat wave. The change in temperature drove whales, many of them threatened or endangered humpbacks, to seek out food sources closer to the California coast, where they were caught in vertical fishing lines that had been strung between crab pots on the ocean floor and buoys bobbing on the surface.\n\nIn response, California state regulators barred Dungeness crab fishing when whales are known to be present. That shortened the season significantly, giving fishermen a narrow window in which to make a living. So some began trying pop-up gear and determined the method works and is worth the additional cost.\n\nThe gear lets fishermen use a remote-operated, acoustic release device to pop-up a crab pot from the ocean floor rather than have it tethered to a floating buoy. Pots can be strung together with ropes laid horizontally instead of vertically, so whales can pass over them while migrating through the area.\n\n\u201cIf you remove the vertical line, you have removed the entanglement risk, and you have allowed a fishery to continue,\u201d said Ryan Bartling, senior environmental scientist supervisor with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.\n\nMany long-time Dungeness crab fishermen have been slow to warm up to the idea due to the cost, which can run $1,000 per pop-up device plus an on-board unit. It also takes time to restring the pots after an intense winter season of derby-style fishing, which takes place when whales are calving in warmer waters to the south.\n\nThere also is a need for a unified tracking system since the gear isn\u2019t visible on the surface, Bartling said.\n\nMore than four dozen whales were entangled in fishing nets in 2015, compared with an annual average of 10 in prior years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nMany were humpback whales, which were listed as endangered in the 1970s and have been recovering since protections were put in place, the agency said.\n\nEnvironmental advocates sued California over the increased entanglements and reached a settlement with the state in 2019 that encouraged the use of ropeless gear.\n\nBart Chadwick, who owns San Diego-based Sub Sea Sonics, said he previously used pop-up technology to retrieve expensive equipment while conducting environmental work at sea. When he retired from his job, he made tweaks so it could be adapted for fishing.\n\n\u201cIt allows them to fish in places they wouldn\u2019t otherwise,\u201d Chadwick said, adding the technology also reduces gear losses.\n\nMost Dungeness crab fishermen make their money during the early part of the season when whales typically aren't near the California coast. Experts say the pop-up gear won't work then due to crowding and the technology is currently being considered solely for the smaller spring season, which starts April 16 in central California.\n\nGeoff Shester, senior scientist at conservation organization Oceana, said he thinks the method could eventually be used more broadly if fishermen find it efficient and cost-effective.\n\n\u201cThink about electric cars, or hybrids, or even digital cameras,\" Shester said. \"Every time you have a new technology, there is a lot of resistance at first.\u201d\n\nCrab fisherman Ben Platt said he was a vocal opponent but will join this year's pilot since multiple pots now can be strung together, making the method simpler and cheaper. Still, he said many fishermen have concerns and aren't likely to get on board.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see and take a look at the results,\u201d Platt said.\n\nFor Stephen Melz, who fishes out of Half Moon Bay, California, having more time out on the ocean is key. Years ago, he said he would go out for Dungeness crab starting in November and fish through the spring.\n\nNow, with the shortened season, he said there is no room for error and the gear helps him get out so he can pay his bills.\n\n\u201cBetter than just sitting at dock,\u201d he said."

He later filed lawsuits against three Republican Missouri state senators and a Tennessee congressman who shared social media posts that falsely implicated him.\n\nThose cases were all dismissed, largely on jurisdictional issues.\n\nAttorney LaRonna Lassiter Saunders confirmed Loudermill\u2019s death in a statement Friday but gave no details on the circumstances. Loudermill was 49.\n\n\u201cMore details will be provided in time, but for now, we ask that you honor the family\u2019s need for privacy as they come together to grieve this tremendous loss,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe Feb. 14, 2024, shooting outside Union Station in Kansas City, Missouri, killed a well-known DJ and injured more than 20 others, many of them children.\n\nLoudermill\u2019s lawsuits said he froze when the gunfire erupted, standing in the middle of the chaos so long that police had put up crime scene tape by the time he finally started to walked away.

But soon posts began appearing on X that included a picture of Loudermill, a car wash employee who was born and raised in the U.S. The posts called him an \u201cillegal alien\u201d and a \u201cshooter,\u201d even though he had no involvement, the lawsuits said.\n\nThree men were ultimately charged with murder, and several other people faced other charges stemming from the shootings, which authorities said stemmed from a dispute between two groups of people.\n\nLassiter Saunders said she would continue fighting to clear Loudermill's name.\n\n\u201cWhile the family takes this time to mourn, we want to make it clear that this is not over. Mr. Loudermill should not have spent his final days burdened with stress and chasing down a lie that went viral due to the careless and heartless actions of a Congressman, Missouri senators, and social media influencers, who couldn\u2019t be bothered to verify the truth before destroying a man\u2019s life.\n\n\"If you thought we were determined before, you haven\u2019t seen anything yet!\u201d she concluded."

(Photo by Mark Von Holden/Invision/AP, File)\n\nNEW YORK -- Lawyers for Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs are urging a judge to let prospective jurors at the hip-hop mogul's upcoming sex trafficking trial be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs and violence.\n\nThe lawyers raised the subject as they submitted a proposed questionnaire to be filled out by individuals summoned for his May 5 trial in Manhattan federal court.\n\nIn a letter to a judge late Friday, the lawyers said they want to know the willingness of would-be jurors to watch videos that are sexually explicit or show physical assault. They also say they want to know their views toward people with multiple sexual partners.\n\nProsecutors in a letter of their own criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all.\n\nThey said some of the defense's proposed 72 questions, some containing subparts, were \u201cutterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\u201d\n\nProsecutors also cited the sex trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell as an example of how a lengthy questionnaire can be damaging.\n\nAfter Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021, a juror admitted that he had failed to disclose that he was a sex abuse victim, blaming his oversight in part on being \u201cdistracted as he filled out the questionnaire\" and having \u201cskimmed way too fast,\u201d causing him to misunderstand questions.\n\nJudge Arun Subramanian has told lawyers that questionnaires will be distributed to hundreds of prospective jurors at the end of April so that questioning of prospective jurors can begin on May 5, with opening statements likely on May 12.\n\nCombs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to allegations that he subjected individuals to sexual abuse over a two-decade period. The Bad Boy Records founder has remained incarcerated without bail since his September arrest.\n\nAn indictment accuses Combs of using the \u201cpower and prestige\u201d he wielded as a music mogul to intimidate, threaten and lure women into his orbit, often under the pretense of a romantic relationship.\n\nThe indictment said he then used force, threats and coercion to cause victims, including three women specified in the court papers, to engage in commercial sex acts.\n\nIt said he subjected his victims to violence, threats of violence, threats of financial and reputational harm and verbal abuse.\n\nProsecutors have said that a key piece of the evidence at trial will be a video showing Combs punching his former protege and girlfriend, the R & B singer Cassie, and throwing her on the floor in a hotel hallway.\n\nDefense lawyers have argued that prosecutors built their case on charges that try to demonize sex acts between consenting adults.\n\nThey told the judge they were unable to reach a consensus with prosecutors for what prospective jurors should be asked on questionnaires.\n\n\u201cThe defense believes it is important that we allow potential jurors to write candidly about the unprecedented and negative media attention that they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs,\u201d the lawyers wrote.\n\nDefense lawyers also asked that jurors be asked to tell if they've watched shows on television titled: \u201cThe Fall of Diddy,\u201d \u201cDiddy Do It?\u201d \u201cThe Downfall of Diddy\u201d and \u201cDiddy: The Making of a Bad Boy.\u201d"

Huh)\n\nAn employee of Learning Resources, an educational toy company, works at a warehouse in Vernon Hills, Ill., Friday, April 11, 2025. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Rick Woldenberg thought he had come up with a sure-fire plan to protect his Chicago-area educational toy company from President Donald Trump\u2019s massive new taxes on Chinese imports.\n\n\"When he announced a 20% tariff, I made a plan to survive 40%, and I thought I was being very clever,\" said Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a third-generation family business that has been manufacturing in China for four decades. \"I had worked out that for a very modest price increase, we could withstand 40% tariffs, which was an unthinkable increase in costs.\"\n\nHis worst-case scenario wasn\u2019t worst-case enough. Not even close.\n\nThe American president quickly upped the ante with China, raising the levy to 54% to offset what he said were China\u2019s unfair trade practices. Then, enraged when China retaliated with tariffs of its own, he upped the levies to a staggering 145%.\n\nWoldenberg reckons that will push Learning Resource\u2019s tariff bill from $2.3 million last year to $100.2 million in 2025. \u201cI wish I had $100 million,\u201d he said. \u201cHonest to God, no exaggeration: It feels like the end of days.\u201d\n\nIt might at least be the end of an era of inexpensive consumer goods in America. For four decades, and especially since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, Americans have relied on Chinese factories for everything from smartphones to Christmas ornaments.\n\nAs tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2014 and geopolitical rivals \u2014 have risen over the past decade, Mexico and Canada have supplanted China as America\u2019s top source of imported goods and services. But China is still No. 3 \u2014 and second behind Mexico in goods alone \u2014 and continues to dominate in many categories.\n\nChina produces 97% of America\u2019s imported baby carriages, 96% of its artificial flowers and umbrellas, 95% of its fireworks, 93% of its children\u2019s coloring books and 90% of its combs, according to a report from the Macquarie investment bank.\n\nOver the years, American companies have set up supply chains that depend on thousands of Chinese factories. Low tariffs greased the system. As recently as January 2018, U.S. tariffs on China averaged just over 3%, according to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\u201cAmerican consumers created China,\u201d said Joe Jurken, founder of the ABC Group in Milwaukee, which helps U.S. businesses manage supply chains in Asia. \u201cAmerican buyers, the consumers, got addicted to cheap pricing. And the brands and the retailers got addicted to the ease of buying from China.\"\n\nNow Trump, demanding that manufacturers return production to America, is swinging a tariff sledgehammer at the American importers and the Chinese factories they rely on.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of tariffs at this scale could be apocalyptic at many levels,\" said David French, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Retail Foundation.\n\nThe Yale University Budget Lab estimates that the tariffs that Trump has announced globally since taking office would lower U.S. economic growth by 1.1 percentage points in 2025.\n\nThe tariffs are also likely to push up prices. The University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment, out Friday, found that Americans expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4%, up from 4.1% last month.\n\n\"Inflation\u2019s going up in the United States,\" said Stephen Roach, former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and now at Yale Law School\u2019s China Center. \u201cConsumers have figured this out as well.\"\n\nIt's not just the size of Trump\u2019s tariffs that has businesses bewildered and scrambling; it\u2019s the speed and the unpredictability with which the president is rolling them out.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House said the tariffs on China would hit 125%. A day later, it corrected that: No, the tariffs would be 145%, including a previously announced 20% to pressure China to do more to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States.\n\nChina in turn has imposed a 125% tariff on the U.S. effective Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere is so much uncertainty,\u201d said Isaac Larian, the founder of MGA Entertainment, which makes L.O.L. and Bratz dolls, among other toys. \u201cAnd no business can run on uncertainty.\u201d\n\nHis company gets 65% of its product from Chinese factories, a share he is trying to winnow down to 40% by the end of the year. MGA also manufactures in India, Vietnam and Cambodia, but Trump is threatening to levy heavy tariffs on those countries, too, after delaying them for 90 days.\n\nLarian estimates that the price of Bratz dolls could go from $15 to $40 and that of L.O.L. dolls could double to $20 by this year's holiday season.\n\nEven his Little Tikes brand, which is made in Ohio, is not immune. Little Tikes depends on screws and other parts from China. Larian figures the price for its toy cars could rise to $90 from a suggested retail price of $65.\n\nHe said MGA would likely cut orders for the fourth quarter because he is worried that higher prices will scare off consumers.\n\nMarc Rosenberg, founder and CEO of The Edge Desk in Deerfield, Illinois, invested millions of dollars of his own money to develop $1,000 ergonomic chairs, which were to start production in China next month.\n\nNow\u2019s he calling off production and exploring markets outside the U.S., including Germany and Italy, where his chairs wouldn\u2019t face Trump\u2019s triple-digit tariffs.\n\nHe had looked for ways to make the chairs in the United States and had discussions with potential suppliers in Michigan, but the costs would have been 25% to 30% higher.\n\n\"They didn\u2019t have the skilled labor to do this stuff, and they didn\u2019t have the desire to do it,\u201d Rosenberg said.\n\nWoldenberg\u2019s company in Vernon Hills, Illinois, has been in the family since 1916. It was started by his grandfather as a laboratory supply company and evolved over the years into Learning Resources.\n\nThe company specializes in educational toys such as Botley: The Coding Robot and the brainteaser Kanoodle. It employs about 500 people \u2014 90% in the United States \u2014 and makes about 2,400 products in China.\n\nWoldenberg is reeling from the size and suddenness of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\n\u201cThe products I make in China, about 60% of what I do, become economically unviable overnight,\u201d he said. \"In an instant, snap of a finger, they\u2019re kaput.\"\n\nHe described Trump\u2019s call for factories to return to the United States as \u201ca joke.\"\n\n\u201cI have been looking for American manufacturers for a long time ... and I have come up with zero companies to partner with,\u201d he said.\n\nThe tariffs, unless they\u2019re reduced or eliminated, will wipe out thousands of small Chinese suppliers, Woldenberg predicted.\n\nThat would spell disaster for companies like his that have installed expensive tools and molds in Chinese factories, he said. The stand to lose not only their manufacturing base but also possibly their tools, which could get caught up in bankruptcies in China.\n\nLearning Resources has about 10,000 molds, weighing collectively more than 5 million pounds, in China.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you just bring in a canvas bag, zip it up and walk out,\u201d Woldenberg said. \u201cThere is no idle manufacturing hub standing fully equipped, full of engineers and qualified people waiting for me to show up with 10,000 molds to make 2,000 products.\"\n\n___\n\nD\u2019Innocenzio reported from New York."

Federal officials said the decision follows President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order forbidding federal agencies from pursuing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\n\u201cThe DOJ will no longer push \u2018environmental justice\u2019 as viewed through a distorting, DEI lens,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division said in a statement.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump made it clear: Americans deserve a government committed to serving every individual with dignity and respect, and to expending taxpayer resources in accordance with the national interest, not arbitrary criteria,\" the statement said.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in February issued a memo rescinding a Biden-era directive to prioritize environmental justice cases.\n\nWastewater sanitation issues are well-documented in Lowndes County. Poverty, inadequate infrastructure and a type of soil that makes it difficult for traditional septic tanks to work have sometimes left some residents with sewage in their yards.\n\nThe Justice Department in 2023 said its probe found Alabama engaged in a pattern of inaction and neglect regarding the risks of raw sewage for county residents. The Alabama Department of Public Health agreed to take several steps as part of the settlement, including not fining people with inadequate home systems, creating a comprehensive plan for the region and other steps.\n\nThe agreement was the result of the Justice Department's first environmental justice investigation under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nU.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, a Democrat whose district includes the county, criticized the decision to end the agreement.\n\n\u201cIt was about addressing a public health crisis that has forced generations of children and families to endure the health hazards of living in proximity to raw sewage, as the DOJ itself documented,\" Sewell said.\n\nShe said that the Trump administration \"has put its blatant disregard for the health of my constituents on full display.\u201d\n\nDr. Scott Harris, Alabama\u2019s state health officer, said his department will continue its work in the region. But he noted that work and efforts to help install new septic systems at homes is dependent upon federal and state funding. American Rescue Plan funds helped provide money for new septic system installations.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change our intent to help as many people as possible,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe real question is going to be what the funding situation looks like.\u201d\n\nCatherine Flowers, an activist who brought attention to the problem in the county, said wastewater sanitation is a problem in many rural areas.\n\n\u201cI pray that today\u2019s action means that this administration will make sanitation a priority for all who are affected throughout rural America,\u201d Flowers said."

    "content": "Trump threatens new tariffs on smartphones days after exempting them\n\n8 hours ago Share Save Madeline Halpert BBC News Share Save\n\nWatch: Is the US heading into a recession? Three warning signs to watch\n\nDonald Trump says Chinese-made smartphones and other electronics will not be exempt from tariffs - adding they are simply moving into a different levy \"bucket\". European stock markets bounced up on Monday morning after Friday's official announcement that some of these products would escape levies of up to 145%. China has called on Donald Trump to \"completely cancel\" his tariffs regime, and \"return to the right path of mutual respect\". However US officials said on Sunday that products would be subject to a \"semiconductor tariff\" instead, with Trump expected to reveal more details later.\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the new levy would be in addition to a host of global tariffs the US imposed earlier this month, then paused for 90 days. \"We need our medicines and we need semiconductors and our electronics to be built in America,\" he added. On Saturday, a US customs notice revealed smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices would be excluded from the 125% tariff on goods entering the country from China. But Trump chimed in on social media, saying there was no exemption for these products and called such reports about this notice false. Instead, he said that \"they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket'\". Trump added: \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\" He said he would provide an update on Monday about semiconductor duties. Everyday devices such as smartphones and laptops rely on semiconductors, which are small and powerful pieces of tech that form the basic building blocks of modern computation. Trump's iPhone olive branch is a significant trade war retreat\n\nTrump's changing tariffs leave shoppers feeling paralysed On Monday, Sony announced that it was increasing the price of its flagship games console, the PlayStation 5, by about 10% in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, citing a \"challenging economic environment\", inflation and fluctuating exchange rates. It did not announce price rises in the United States. The Chinese commerce ministry had called Trump's exemptions a \"small step\" by the US, and said that Beijing was \"evaluating the impact\" of the move. But the suggestion by Trump administration officials of plans for future levies may dampen hopes of a thaw in the two rivals' protectionist posture. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer was asked on Sunday whether there were any plans for Trump to speak with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. \"Right now we don't have any plans on that,\" he said during an appearance on CBS's Face the Nation. Trump imposed a tariff amounting to 54% on imports of products from China at the beginning of April, before escalating to the current 145% rate."

Cody Balmer, 38, has been charged with attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault. Authorities say Balmer used Molotov cocktails to start the blaze. Shapiro, his wife, his four children and guests and staff members were able to escape unscathed, but the official residence in the state capital of Harrisburg was severely damaged.\n\nAccording to a police report, Balmer, a Harrisburg resident, walked for about an hour from his home, scaled a perimeter fence, used a hammer to break two windows and set the building alight at around 01:30 local time Sunday. He initially evaded state troopers but turned himself into authorities several hours later. Police say they searched Balmer's home and found clothes and a hammer which match items that the attacker was seen wearing and holding on surveillance video captured at the governor's residence. An ex-girlfriend of Balmer contacted police and said that Balmer was responsible for setting the fire, according to the police report. Authorities did not identify a motive. In an interview with CBS, the BBC's US news partner, Cody Balmer's mother Christie Balmer said that her son struggles with mental illness and recently stopped taking psychiatric medication. \"This would have never happened if I could have gotten some help the middle of last week because I tried to get him picked up [by police] \u2026 and I went through four police departments and I couldn't get anybody to help,\" she said. \"So he was mentally ill, went off his meds, and this is what happened,\" she said.\n\nHandout/Commonwealth Media Services\n\nA Facebook account that matches the name, location and other personal details of the suspect included a number of posts both criticising former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and mocking supporters of President Donald Trump, a Republican.

I want my kids to be OK.\" \"I refuse to be trapped by the bondage that someone attempted to put on me by attacking us as they did last night,\" he told reporters.

    "content": "Blue Origin crew safely back on Earth after all-female space flight\n\n2 hours ago Share Save Maddie Molloy BBC Climate & Science reporter Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News Share Save\n\nDave Limp / Blue Origin The all-women crew \u2014 including Katy Perry and Lauren S\u00e1nchez \u2014 celebrate their successful mission alongside Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin executive Audrey Powers, and CEO Dave Limp\n\nPop star Katy Perry and five other women safely returned to Earth after reaching space aboard Jeff Bezos' rocket. The singer was joined by Bezos's fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez and CBS presenter Gayle King, who said a highlight of the flight was hearing Perry sing Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\". The New Shepard rocket lifted off from its West Texas launch site just after 08:30 local time (14:30 BST). The flight lasted around 11 minutes and took the six women more than 100km (62 miles) above Earth, crossing the internationally recognised boundary of space and giving them a few moments of weightlessness.\n\nAlso on board were former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn. The capsule returned to Earth with a parachute-assisted soft landing, while the rocket booster also landed back in Texas. Cheering could be heard from inside the capsule as the recovery crew went to collect them. Jeff Bezos opened the capsule door to welcome back Lauren S\u00e1nchez, the first to disembark. \"I'm so proud of this crew,\" she said tearfully. \"I can't put it into words.\" She paused, before adding: \"I looked out of the window and we got to see the moon.\" \"Earth looked so quiet,\" she said, adding that it was not what she expected. \"It was quiet, but really alive.\" Next out was Katy Perry, who kissed the ground and lifted a daisy to the sky - her daughter is called Daisy. Gayle King also got on her knees and kissed the ground. \"I just want to have a moment with the ground, just appreciate the ground for just a second,\" she said. The last to get out, Kerianne Flynn, pointed at the sky and shouted: \"I went to space.\" A celebrity cast had watched the launch from the ground. Speaking from the viewing platform, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian said: \"I didn't realise how emotional it would be, it's hard to explain. I have all this adrenaline and I'm just standing here.\" \"Whatever you dream of is in our reach, especially in today's day and age. Dream big, wish for the stars\u2014and one day, you could maybe be amongst them.\"\u200b she added. Oprah Winfrey spoke about her friend Gayle King, and revealed she was a nervous flier. \"I mean, for her\u2014whew\u2014anytime we're on a flight, she's in somebody's lap at the slightest bit of turbulence. She has real, real-world anxiety when it comes to flying. And this... this is her overcoming a wall of fear,\" she said. The spacecraft was fully autonomous, requiring no pilots, and the crew did not manually operate the vehicle. Blue Origin says the last all-female spaceflight was over 60 years ago when Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space on a solo mission aboard the spacecraft Vostok 6. Since then, there have been no other all-female spaceflights but women have made numerous significant contributions. The space tourism industry is still in its infancy, so every successful launch is significant and demonstrates that these short, commercial flights can be carried out safely.\n\nGetty Images The New Shepard rocket lifted off against the backdrop of the Van Horn hills, and lasted around 11 minutes\n\nBut some critics stress it is tourism, not space science, and professional astronauts undertake missions, including scientific research, for the benefit of humankind. \"A celebrity isn't an envoy of humankind - they go into space for their own reasons,\" Dr Kai-Uwe Schrogl, special advisor for political affairs at the European Space Agency, told BBC News. \"These flights are significant and exciting, but I think maybe they can also be a source of frustration for space scientists,\" he added. \"We see space flight as being for science, knowledge and the interests of humanity. \"Celebrities do it for amusement but get a lot more attention than the regular astronauts.\" In a news conference after the flight, two of the women took issue with some of the criticism the mission had received, related for example to its cost. \"I feel that anybody who is criticising doesn't really understand what's happening here,\" said Gayle King. She said that the astronauts had had a huge, positive response from young women and young girls. Lauren S\u00e1nchez said she had got \"fired up\" about the criticism and would love to have the naysayers come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees who \"put their heart and soul into\" the missions.\n\nBlue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon. Although Blue Origin has not released full ticket prices, a $150,000 (\u00a3114,575.85) deposit is required to reserve a seat\u2014underlining the exclusivity of these early flights. Alongside its suborbital tourism business, the company is also developing long-term space infrastructure, including reusable rockets and lunar landing systems. The New Shepard rocket is designed to be fully reusable and its booster returns to the launch pad for vertical landings after each flight, reducing overall costs. According to US law, astronauts must complete comprehensive training for their specific roles. Blue Origin says its New Shepard passengers are trained over two days with a focus on physical fitness, emergency protocols, details about the safety measures and procedures for zero gravity. Additionally, there are two support members referred to as Crew Member Seven: one provides continuous guidance to astronauts, while the other maintains communication from the control room during the mission.\n\nThe rise of space tourism has prompted criticism that it is too exclusive and environmentally damaging. Supporters argue that private companies are accelerating innovation and making space more accessible. Professor Brian Cox told the BBC in 2024: \"Our civilisation needs to expand beyond our planet for so many reasons,\" and believes that collaboration between NASA and commercial firms is a positive step.

    "content": "'A stab in the back' - car workers in Canada hit out at US over tariffs\n\n19 hours ago Share Save Ali Abbas Ahmadi BBC News Reporting from Windsor, Ontario Share Save\n\nAli Abbas Ahmadi/BBC Ford workers Kathryn Lawton (L) and Christina Grossi are afraid the tariffs could upend their lives\n\nFor more than a century, a member of the Lawton family has worked in Canada's car industry. Kathryn Lawton and husband Chad both work for the carmaker in Windsor, the heart of Canada's automobile sector, just a bridge away from the US state of Michigan. And so do their children, who are \"fifth generation Ford workers\", she says. So when US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada stole the American auto industry, Chad Lawton calls it \"ludicrous\". \"These were never American jobs. These were Canadian jobs,\" he told the BBC, on the day that Trump's auto tariffs came into force. \"They've always been Canadian jobs, and they're going to stay Canadian jobs because we didn't take them from them. We created them, we sustained them.\" Kathryn agreed: \"This is Ford City right here.\" Tucked away in southwestern Ontario, Windsor finds itself on one of the front lines of Trump's trade war. It faces a 25% tariff on foreign-made vehicles - reduced by half for cars made with 50% US-made components or more - as well as blanket 25% US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. US tariffs on auto parts are expected next month.\n\nAli Abbas Ahmadi/BBC A mural harking back to the history of the Windsor neighbourhood around the Ford plant, when it was known simply as 'Ford City'\n\nThe region of just over 422,000 grew alongside Detroit - nicknamed Motor City for its role as an auto manufacturing hub - turning the region into an important centre for North American automobile production. Ford first established its presence in Windsor in 1896, while the first Stellantis (then Chrysler) factory arrived in 1928, with dozens of factories and suppliers springing up around the city and surrounding region in the ensuing decades. Much of the manufacturing has since left the city, though it still boasts two Ford engine factories and a Stellantis assembly plant, which employ thousands. WATCH: Is the US heading for a recession?\n\nEXPLAINER: What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them? Workers on both sides of the border have built iconic vehicles over the decades, most recently models like the Dodge Charger and the Ford F-150. Some 24,000 people work directly in the automotive industry in Windsor-Essex, while an estimated 120,000 other jobs depend on the sector. A drive through the neighbourhood around the Ford factory feels like a trip back in time, showcasing classic bungalows from the last century. Many have seen better days, though each boasts a verandah and small front yard. Large murals celebrating the city's automotive history punctuate the scenery.\n\nAli Abbas Ahmadi/BBC Chad Lawton has been at Ford for 31 years, and says he has never seen a crisis like this\n\nWindsor has weathered the challenges of the North American auto sector alongside Michigan, as the industry shares a deeply integrated supply chain. Chad Lawton points to the 2008 financial crisis, when the Big Three American automakers - Ford, General Motors and Chrysler - faced staggering losses, and GM and Chrysler received billions in US bailouts to avoid bankruptcy. That period was \"bad, not just for next door, but also we went through a very, very rough time\", he said. \"This feels the same. The level of anxiety with the workers, the level of fear, the idea and the belief that this is just something that is so completely out of your control that you can't wrap your head around what to do.\" John D'Agnolo, president of Unifor Local 200, which represents Ford workers in Windsor, said the situation \"has created havoc\". \"I think we're going to see a recession,\" he said. He continued: \"People aren't going to buy anything. I gotta tell my members not to buy anything. They gotta pay rent and food for their kids.\"\n\nAli Abbas Ahmadi/BBC Windsor residents have a front-row seat to Detroit and the struggles of its auto sector\n\nWhat makes the tariffs such a hard pill to swallow for auto workers the BBC spoke to is that this situation has been brought about by the US, Canada's closest economic and security ally. \"It seems like a stab in the back,\" said Austin Welzel, 27, an assembly line worker at Stellantis. \"It's almost like our neighbors, our friends - they don't want to work with us.\" Christina Grossi, who has worked at Ford for 25 years, said the prospect of losing her job, and what it will mean to her family, is \"terrifying\". But Ms Grossi also fears losing the meaning she gets from her work. \"You've been doing this job for so long and you really take pride in it, you're proud of what you're putting out to the public,\" she said. \"And now someone's taking away the opportunity to do that.\"\n\nLaura Dawson, the executive director of Future Borders Coalition, said the tariffs could cause major upheavals throughout the sector due to its deep integration, with ripple effects felt across the continent if exports from Canada stop for more than a week. She said the US tariffs structure is extremely complicated. Cars crossing the border will need every component to be assessed for \"qualifying content\" - where it originates, the cost of labour to produce it, and - if it contains steel or aluminium - where that metal came from. \"Every part of an automobile is literally under a microscope for where it was produced and how,\" she said. The US tariffs have been a major factor in Canada's general election, which is on 28 April, with Canada's political parties rolling out suites of plans on the campaign trail to help the auto sector. A simple guide to Canada's federal election\n\nWho's who in Canada's federal election\n\nLISTEN: World Questions programme - Canada Liberal leader Mark Carney, the current prime minister, has pledged to create a C$2bn ($1.4bn; \u00a31.1bn) fund to boost competitiveness and protect manufacturing jobs, alongside plans to build an \"all-in-Canada\" auto component parts network. In his role as prime minister, he imposed last week a reported C$35bn in counter auto tariffs, in addition to previously announced reciprocal measures on the US. Carney's main rival, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, has vowed to remove sales tax on Canadian vehicles, and to create a fund for companies affected by the tariffs to help keep their employees. Jagmeet Singh, whose left-wing New Democratic Party is fighting for a competitive seat in Windsor, has pledged to use every dollar from counter tariffs to help workers, and to stop manufacturers from moving equipment to the US.\n\nAli Abbas Ahmadi/BBC Many patrons at Van Niforos's restaurant work for Stellantis"

    "content": "'A stab in the back' - car workers in Canada hit out at US over tariffs\n\n19 hours ago Share Save Ali Abbas Ahmadi BBC News Reporting from Windsor, Ontario Share Save\n\nAli Abbas Ahmadi/BBC Ford workers Kathryn Lawton (L) and Christina Grossi are afraid the tariffs could upend their lives\n\nFor more than a century, a member of the Lawton family has worked in Canada's car industry. Kathryn Lawton and husband Chad both work for the carmaker in Windsor, the heart of Canada's automobile sector, just a bridge away from the US state of Michigan. And so do their children, who are \"fifth generation Ford workers\", she says. So when US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada stole the American auto industry, Chad Lawton calls it \"ludicrous\". \"These were never American jobs. These were Canadian jobs,\" he told the BBC, on the day that Trump's auto tariffs came into force. \"They've always been Canadian jobs, and they're going to stay Canadian jobs because we didn't take them from them. We created them, we sustained them.\" Kathryn agreed: \"This is Ford City right here.\" Tucked away in southwestern Ontario, Windsor finds itself on one of the front lines of Trump's trade war. It faces a 25% tariff on foreign-made vehicles - reduced by half for cars made with 50% US-made components or more - as well as blanket 25% US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. US tariffs on auto parts are expected next month.\n\nAli Abbas Ahmadi/BBC A mural harking back to the history of the Windsor neighbourhood around the Ford plant, when it was known simply as 'Ford City'\n\nThe region of just over 422,000 grew alongside Detroit - nicknamed Motor City for its role as an auto manufacturing hub - turning the region into an important centre for North American automobile production. Ford first established its presence in Windsor in 1896, while the first Stellantis (then Chrysler) factory arrived in 1928, with dozens of factories and suppliers springing up around the city and surrounding region in the ensuing decades. Much of the manufacturing has since left the city, though it still boasts two Ford engine factories and a Stellantis assembly plant, which employ thousands. WATCH: Is the US heading for a recession?\n\nEXPLAINER: What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them? Workers on both sides of the border have built iconic vehicles over the decades, most recently models like the Dodge Charger and the Ford F-150. Some 24,000 people work directly in the automotive industry in Windsor-Essex, while an estimated 120,000 other jobs depend on the sector. A drive through the neighbourhood around the Ford factory feels like a trip back in time, showcasing classic bungalows from the last century. Many have seen better days, though each boasts a verandah and small front yard. Large murals celebrating the city's automotive history punctuate the scenery.\n\nAli Abbas Ahmadi/BBC Chad Lawton has been at Ford for 31 years, and says he has never seen a crisis like this\n\nWindsor has weathered the challenges of the North American auto sector alongside Michigan, as the industry shares a deeply integrated supply chain. Chad Lawton points to the 2008 financial crisis, when the Big Three American automakers - Ford, General Motors and Chrysler - faced staggering losses, and GM and Chrysler received billions in US bailouts to avoid bankruptcy. That period was \"bad, not just for next door, but also we went through a very, very rough time\", he said. \"This feels the same. The level of anxiety with the workers, the level of fear, the idea and the belief that this is just something that is so completely out of your control that you can't wrap your head around what to do.\" John D'Agnolo, president of Unifor Local 200, which represents Ford workers in Windsor, said the situation \"has created havoc\". \"I think we're going to see a recession,\" he said. He continued: \"People aren't going to buy anything. I gotta tell my members not to buy anything. They gotta pay rent and food for their kids.\"\n\nAli Abbas Ahmadi/BBC Windsor residents have a front-row seat to Detroit and the struggles of its auto sector\n\nWhat makes the tariffs such a hard pill to swallow for auto workers the BBC spoke to is that this situation has been brought about by the US, Canada's closest economic and security ally. \"It seems like a stab in the back,\" said Austin Welzel, 27, an assembly line worker at Stellantis. \"It's almost like our neighbors, our friends - they don't want to work with us.\" Christina Grossi, who has worked at Ford for 25 years, said the prospect of losing her job, and what it will mean to her family, is \"terrifying\". But Ms Grossi also fears losing the meaning she gets from her work. \"You've been doing this job for so long and you really take pride in it, you're proud of what you're putting out to the public,\" she said. \"And now someone's taking away the opportunity to do that.\"\n\nLaura Dawson, the executive director of Future Borders Coalition, said the tariffs could cause major upheavals throughout the sector due to its deep integration, with ripple effects felt across the continent if exports from Canada stop for more than a week. She said the US tariffs structure is extremely complicated. Cars crossing the border will need every component to be assessed for \"qualifying content\" - where it originates, the cost of labour to produce it, and - if it contains steel or aluminium - where that metal came from. \"Every part of an automobile is literally under a microscope for where it was produced and how,\" she said. The US tariffs have been a major factor in Canada's general election, which is on 28 April, with Canada's political parties rolling out suites of plans on the campaign trail to help the auto sector. A simple guide to Canada's federal election\n\nWho's who in Canada's federal election\n\nLISTEN: World Questions programme - Canada Liberal leader Mark Carney, the current prime minister, has pledged to create a C$2bn ($1.4bn; \u00a31.1bn) fund to boost competitiveness and protect manufacturing jobs, alongside plans to build an \"all-in-Canada\" auto component parts network. In his role as prime minister, he imposed last week a reported C$35bn in counter auto tariffs, in addition to previously announced reciprocal measures on the US. Carney's main rival, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, has vowed to remove sales tax on Canadian vehicles, and to create a fund for companies affected by the tariffs to help keep their employees. Jagmeet Singh, whose left-wing New Democratic Party is fighting for a competitive seat in Windsor, has pledged to use every dollar from counter tariffs to help workers, and to stop manufacturers from moving equipment to the US.\n\nAli Abbas Ahmadi/BBC Many patrons at Van Niforos's restaurant work for Stellantis"

The test is commonly used to detect cognitive decline and early signs of dementia and has tasks such as naming animals, drawing a clock and repeating words back five minutes later.\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump said he \"got every answer right\" on the cognitive test.\n\n\"Overall, I felt I was in very good shape,\" Trump said. \"A good heart, a good soul, a very good soul.\"\n\nHe added that doctors had given him \"a little bit\" of advice on lifestyle changes to improve his health, though he did not provide details.\n\nDr Barbabella also said Trump had \"minor sun damage\" and a few \"benign skin lesions\".\n\nThe president takes several medications to control his cholesterol - Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe - as well as Aspirin for cardiac prevention and Mometasone cream for a skin condition, said the memo.\n\nTrump's cardiac examination showed \"no abnormalities\", wrote Dr Barbabella.\n\nThe examination noted the president's medical history of \"well-controlled hypercholesterolemia\", a condition which can increase a patient's risk of a heart attack.\n\nOther conditions noted in his medical history included a past Covid infection, rosacea, which is a skin condition often causing redness in the face, and a benign colon polyp.\n\nThe president weighs 224lb (101kg) and stands 6ft 2.5in tall, according to the records from Dr Barbabella. Trump has shed some pounds since February 2019, when he weighed 243lb.\n\nUnder the Body Mass Index calculator, he would currently be categorised within the overweight range, and not obese.\n\nThe memo noted that the president's \"joints and muscles have a full range of motion\", while crediting his good health to an active lifestyle, including \"frequent victories in golf events\".\n\nIt is the first medical report on Trump released to the public since a gunman tried to kill him at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July, grazing his ear with a bullet.\n\nAt the time, Trump's former White House doctor, Ronny Jackson, released a report saying his injuries from the incident were superficial.\n\nDuring Trump's first term in office, a White House doctor said he was in good health but needed to lose weight and exercise.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump frequently attacked his rival, Biden, over his cognitive and physical health.\n\nAfter a poor debate performance last year against Trump, Biden declined to commit to taking a cognitive test, which he said he had not undergone while in office."

Voting day will officially be on Monday 28 April. It will be the first election in a decade without former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the ballot, and the two major parties in Canada - the Conservatives and the Liberals - are locked in a tight race. While Canadians don't vote for prime minister directly, the leader of the party that wins the most seats will traditionally become head of government. Here is a breakdown of the leaders of Canada's major parties.\n\nLiberal Party leader Mark Carney\n\nGetty Images Mark Carney\n\nCarney, 60, is the incumbent prime minister of Canada, but he has only been on the job for a few weeks. His party overwhelmingly chose him - with more than 85% of the vote - to succeed Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader in early March. He became prime minister shortly after, following Trudeau's resignation. For many in Canada and the UK, Carney is a familiar face. He was head of both the Banks of Canada and England, serving at the former during the 2008 financial crash and the latter during Brexit. He was born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, making him the first Canadian prime minister from the north. Carney later grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, before he attended Harvard University and then Oxford, where he studied economics. Carney is hailed for his financial expertise. He has also taken a defiant stance against US President Donald Trump, vowing retaliation against his tariffs and stating that Canada will never become the 51st US state. But Carney is politically untested. He has never been elected to public office in Canada, and this general election will be his very first. His French is also weak, which could be a liability among voters who feel strongly about preserving Canada's French-speaking heritage, especially in the province of Quebec, though so far polls have not suggested it's dragging him down in the province.\n\nConservative leader Pierre Poilievre\n\nGetty Images Pierre Poilievre\n\nPoilievre, 45, originally hails from Calgary, Alberta. He has been in Canadian politics for nearly two decades - first elected to the House of Commons at age 25, making him one of the youngest MPs at the time. Since then, he has consistently advocated for a low-tax, small government in Canada. He is known for his confrontational style of politics. In recent years, Poilievre has tirelessly attacked the Liberals and Trudeau, saying that their \"disastrous\" and \"woke\" policies have worsened the quality of life in Canada, while promising a return to \"common sense politics\" if his party were to form government. It is a message that has resonated with many Canadians who have been worried about the country's housing crisis, stagnant wages and high cost of living. Poilievre has led in national polls since mid-2023, and analysts had projected a near-certain win for his party in the upcoming election.\n\nBut the Liberal Party has since moved slightly ahead in the polls, following Trudeau's resignation, Trump's inauguration, and the rise of Carney as Liberal leader. Poilievre has been criticised for his populist style of politics and has drawn comparisons to Trump at a time when Canadians have rejected the US President's tariffs and his rhetoric that Canada should become the \"51st state\". Poilievre has sought to shift his messaging since, distancing himself from Trump and vowing to put \"Canada first.\" Trump himself has said that Poilievre is not \"MAGA enough\", though the Conservative leader has been praised by Trump ally and tech titan Elon Musk.\n\nWatch: Canada snap election - what happens now?\n\nBloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet\n\nGetty Images Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet\n\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is a Quebec nationalist party that only runs candidates in the French-speaking province, meaning its leader is unlikely to become Canada's next prime minister. Still, they are a key player in Canadian elections, and their popularity in Quebec could determine the fate of the other major parties looking to form government. Blanchet has led the party since 2019. He is known for his frankness, calling Trump's 51st state rhetoric nonsense. \"It's enough jibber-jabber,\" Blanchet said during an address on Trump's tariffs earlier this month in Montreal. \"We can say whatever we want, but that doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.\" He has also dismissed Trump's tariffs, saying: \"I'm sure there will be somebody on his plane between a basketball game and a baseball game to tell him, don't do that, because it's bad for us. I'm sure that at the end of the day, the voice of reason will prevail.\" On domestic issues, Blanchet has pushed for Quebec to diversify its trade partners, and has asked for a prominent seat at Canada's economic planning table, noting that his province is home to the largest aluminium sector in the country - a commodity that has been targeted by US tariffs. Blanchet has also suggested that the appetite for an independent Quebec will \"come roaring back\" when and if the US-Canada relationship stabilises. Polling shows the Bloc - who are going into the election with 33 seats in Parliament - have been trailing behind the Liberal Party in Quebec.\n\nNew Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh\n\nGetty Images Jagmeet Singh\n\nSingh, 46, is leader of the NDP, a left-leaning party that traditionally focuses on worker and labour issues. He made history in 2017 when he became the first ethnic minority and practising Sikh to lead a major political party in Canada. In 2019, the former criminal defence lawyer was elected as an MP in a British Columbia riding, where he has served in public office since. The NDP had helped the Trudeau Liberal government keep its hold on power since 2021, providing needed votes in Parliament in exchange for support on progressive legislation like dental benefits for lower-income families and a national pharmacare programme covering birth control and insulin. But in late 2024, Singh tore up that \"supply and confidence\" agreement, after Trudeau's cabinet directed its industrial relations board to impose binding arbitration to end a work stoppage at Canada's two largest railways. At the time, Singh had said that the Liberals \"let people down\" and didn't \"deserve another chance from Canadians\". But his party has struggled to shore up support. Polls show that only 8.5% of Canadians intend to vote for them as of mid-April, with their ground shrinking while support for the Liberals has risen. A big question will be whether the NDP will be able to grow the number of seats they occupy in the House of Commons and maintain official party status. In the early 2010s, the party had enough support to form the official opposition, meaning it was the party with the second-most seats in Parliament. By 2021, their seat number had shrunk to 24 out of 338."

    "content": "A simple guide to Canada's federal election\n\n5 days ago Share Save Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nMark Carney, former two-time central banker, was sworn in as Canada's new prime minister last month after being elected leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. Shortly after, he called a snap general election. Several political leaders had called for a vote after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he was resigning as leader of the Liberals in January. But after US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on the country, sparking a trade war, calls grew for Canada to go to the polls as soon as possible.\n\nWhen is the next Canadian federal election?\n\nWith the snap election call, Carney is sending Canadians the polls in a matter of weeks. The election will be held on Monday 28 April. By law, the maximum time between federal elections in Canada is five years. The next vote was officially scheduled for 20 October 2025. However, there are a couple of scenarios in which an early election can be triggered: When the governor general accepts the prime minister's advice to dissolve government, or\n\nIf the governor general accepts the PM's resignation after the government is defeated in a confidence vote in parliament The first scenario is what Carney did last month. Are you a Canadian voter? We want to hear from you\n\nWho could be prime minister?\n\nIn the Canadian federal election - as in the UK's general election - voters do not cast a ballot directly for a prime minister. Instead, the leader of the party with the majority of members of parliament (MPs) becomes PM. That means Carney will be in the running, along with Pierre Poilievre, who leads the opposition Conservative Party, and Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party.\n\nWhich parties will run candidates in the election?\n\nFour main parties will contest the next election - the Liberals, the Conservatives, the New Democrats (NDP) and the Bloc Quebecois. The Liberal Party has been in power since 2015, when Trudeau was voted in. At dissolution, it held 153 seats. The Conservatives were the official opposition with 120 seats. The Bloc Quebecois, which only runs candidates in the province of Quebec, had 33 seats, and the NDP had 24. The Green Party held two seats. During the latter stages of Trudeau's premiership, opinion polls consistently showed the Conservatives with a strong lead. But the numbers tightened after Trudeau stepped down. Following Trump's decision to introduce steep tariffs against Canada, they tightened further, suggesting a neck-and-neck race. By early April, polls indicated the Liberals have taken a slight lead.\n\nWhat do the polls say?\n\nWhen Trudeau resigned at the beginning of 2025, he did so under significant pressure from his own party. It was felt that his personal unpopularity was damaging the Liberals' hopes of winning the next election. National polling averages, shared by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), suggest how support for the Liberals weakened throughout 2023 and 2024. At the same time, support for the Conservatives soared. On 20 January 2025 - the day of Trump's inauguration - the Conservatives were polling 44.8% while the Liberals were on 21.9%. Since then, polls suggest that support for the Liberals has ticked back up. The latest averages indicate that - on a national average - more than 40% of Canadians back the Liberals, while just under 40% support the Conservatives. This marks the first time in three years the Liberals are leading in the polls. How to respond to President Trump's economic threats has overtaken the cost of living as the dominant issue for voters. How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics\n\nHow does the Canadian federal election work?\n\nThere are 343 federal ridings - also called constituencies or electoral districts -across the country. Each has a corresponding seat in the House of Commons. All the seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs during an election. Members of the Senate, the upper chamber, are appointed and do not run for election. Like the UK, Canada has a \"first-past-the-post\" electoral system. The candidate who gets the most votes in each riding wins that seat and become an MP. They do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Other parties win nothing in that area. The leader of the party with the largest number of elected MPs normally forms the government. The second-placed party usually forms the official opposition. If no party ends up with an overall majority of seats, the result is known as a hung parliament or a minority government. Practically, it means the party with the most seats will not be able to pass legislation without the help of other parties.\n\nWho can vote in the Canadian federal election?"

During the latter stages of Trudeau's premiership, opinion polls consistently showed the Conservatives with a strong lead. But the numbers tightened after Trudeau stepped down. Following Trump's decision to introduce steep tariffs against Canada, they tightened further, suggesting a neck-and-neck race. By early April, polls indicated the Liberals have taken a slight lead.\n\nWhat do the polls say?\n\nWhen Trudeau resigned at the beginning of 2025, he did so under significant pressure from his own party. It was felt that his personal unpopularity was damaging the Liberals' hopes of winning the next election. National polling averages, shared by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), suggest how support for the Liberals weakened throughout 2023 and 2024. At the same time, support for the Conservatives soared. On 20 January 2025 - the day of Trump's inauguration - the Conservatives were polling 44.8% while the Liberals were on 21.9%. Since then, polls suggest that support for the Liberals has ticked back up. The latest averages indicate that - on a national average - more than 40% of Canadians back the Liberals, while just under 40% support the Conservatives. This marks the first time in three years the Liberals are leading in the polls. How to respond to President Trump's economic threats has overtaken the cost of living as the dominant issue for voters. How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics\n\nHow does the Canadian federal election work?\n\nThere are 343 federal ridings - also called constituencies or electoral districts -across the country. Each has a corresponding seat in the House of Commons. All the seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs during an election. Members of the Senate, the upper chamber, are appointed and do not run for election. Like the UK, Canada has a \"first-past-the-post\" electoral system. The candidate who gets the most votes in each riding wins that seat and become an MP. They do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Other parties win nothing in that area. The leader of the party with the largest number of elected MPs normally forms the government. The second-placed party usually forms the official opposition. If no party ends up with an overall majority of seats, the result is known as a hung parliament or a minority government. Practically, it means the party with the most seats will not be able to pass legislation without the help of other parties.\n\nWho can vote in the Canadian federal election?"

    "content": "'I can't keep up': Trump's changing tariffs leave shoppers feeling paralysed\n\n1 day ago Share Save Natalie Sherman BBC News Reporting from New York, New York Share Save\n\nBBC Days after Richard Medina went looking for a smartphone to beat new tariffs, the US announced the devices would be exempt from the duties\n\nWhen his camera stopped working on his iPhone recently, New Yorker Richard Medina didn't waste any time. With the threat of tariff-fuelled price hikes on smartphones bearing down, he quickly called his phone company for a new one. \"I said, 'We've got to switch this out now,'\" the 43-year-old recalled. \"Let's take care of it.\" The move was a sign of the pressure rising across the US, where households are being buffeted by what could be staggering price rises, and even possible shortages triggered by the sweeping tariffs that US President Donald Trump announced this month. Some are trying to stock up. Others say they feel paralysed by the changes, which have come quickly, or hope Trump will change his mind and reverse course - not an entirely unreasonable hope given the rapid changes in policy. Trump, facing financial market revolt over his latest tariffs, has already altered his plans repeatedly. First, he scaled back duties that had been planned on some countries, such as the European Union, in what was described as a 90-day pause. Then, as market turmoil continued, he exempted smartphones and other electronics from the duties, announcing the carve-out just a few days after Mr Medina felt pressure to make a purchase. \"I can't keep up with the president. Every day is something new,\" said Anna Woods, 42, who recently received a message from her son's summer camp warning that the tariffs might affect pricing of standard gear such as T-shirts. The 42-year-old, who works in legal operations, says she is nervous but unclear how to proceed. \"I just feel like we're living in uncertain times,\" she said, adding: \"I do need to make some purchases .... Everything is going up.\"\n\nAnna Woods is worried about summer camp costs for her son\n\nThe latest tariffs include a 10% tax on the vast majority of imports - and an eye-popping 145% duty on goods from China, which is the third biggest supplier of imports to the US after the European Union and Mexico and a key source of essentials such as smartphones, shoes and umbrellas. The measures followed previous orders that added 25% levies on cars, steel, aluminium and some goods from Canada and Mexico. In all, Trump's orders have pushed the average effective tariff rate on imports in the US to the highest level in more than a century.\n\nIn stores, the immediate impact has been limited, since many firms stockpiled some products in anticipation of some tariffs. But the tariffs are widely expected to lead to higher prices in the months ahead, especially for items such as clothing, leather goods, electronics and toys, many of which are made in China. The Budget Lab at Yale forecasts that prices for clothing could soar by more than 60% in the short run; basic pharmaceutical products could jump by 12%, and food prices rise by 2.6%. All told, the typical US family is facing a roughly $4,700 jump in costs due to the new taxes, if purchase patterns remain the same, it estimates.\n\nJamie Casey is monitoring prices and worried about the future\n\n\"I'm extremely worried about it,\" said 38-year-old mother Jamie Casey, one of more than a dozen people shopping at a Target in Brooklyn on a recent afternoon who shared their thoughts with the BBC about the tariffs. She was in the store picking up formula - and some onesies and outfits for her daughter, who has yet to turn one. \"I wouldn't say I'm panic-buying yet, but I am interested in how it plays out.\"\n\nMajor retailers experienced a jump in visits in the weeks leading up to Trump's tariff announcement, according to research firm Placer.ai, while purchases at the likes of Walmart and Target increased markedly in the immediate aftermath, according to data tracked by ConsumerEdge. There has also been an uptick in US purchases on Amazon's e-commerce platform, where Chinese sellers dominate, CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC recently. \"I don't know if we can necessarily conclude it's panic-buying but there seems to be broad stock-up behaviour,\" said Michael Gunther, head of insights at ConsumerEdge, noting that two separate data sets used by the firm showed a pick-up.\n\nCristina Montoya said she had been buying extra canned food and frozen fruit, a little at a time for a few months, anxious about possible price increases, especially as a pensioner reliant on a fixed income. \"You never used to do your shopping nervous,\" the 74-year-old said. \"I feel like you have to buy a lot of things because you don't know what's going to happen.\"\n\nCristina Montoya is on a fixed income and worried over the uncertainty\n\nThe dynamic has added to the tariff turmoil. Last week, as the measures came into effect, some businesses started introducing tariff surcharges, while others abruptly cancelled shipments from China, unwilling to risk being unable to recoup the cost of the duties. The disruption has the potential to cause near-term shortages in the US of items where China dominates the supply, such as baby carriages, colouring books and umbrellas, analysts at Macquarie noted this week.\n\nAnalysts say the pickup in consumer purchases is likely to prove temporary, or an acceleration of transactions that would have happened anyway. If price rises start to hit, many economists expect Americans to opt for cheaper substitutes, delay purchases, or simply do without - a pullback with major consequences for an economy driven by consumer spending. Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, is predicting the US economy will grow just 0.5% this year, and the unemployment rate will rise to 5% - the highest level since 2021 amid Covid. Other firms, such as JP Morgan, are forecasting an outright recession. \"In terms of the consumer, it does get a little tricky,\" Ms Bostjancic said. \"We could see consumer spending actually be strong in March and April but it's just because of this surge ahead of the tariff increases,\" she added. \"Going forward, consumer spending is going to be weaker.\""

    "content": "Deadly measles outbreak does little to counter vaccine scepticism in Texas\n\n2 days ago Share Save Madeline Halpert BBC News Reporting from Western Texas Share Save\n\nHealth Secretary Robert Kennedy Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr traveled to be with the Mennonite community after a second child died of measles\n\nOn an unusually crisp April day in a rural Texas town, dozens of Mennonite community members gathered alongside the nation's top health official, Robert F Kennedy Jr, to mourn the death of an eight-year-old. Daisy Hildebrand is the second unvaccinated girl from the community to die from measles in two months. Officials in Seminole town also joined the reception after her funeral to support the family, said South Plains Public Health Director Zach Holbrooks. This time, there was no talk of the vaccine that prevents measles deaths - unlike many of his long days since the outbreak began. \"The focus was on their healing,\" Mr Holbrooks said. \"You never want to see anybody pass away, especially a child that young, from any kind of illness, because there is a prevention for it - the MMR vaccine.\" Like other Seminole natives, Mr Holbrooks was not vaccinated against measles as a child. He got a shot in college, and another in February, when his hometown became the epicentre of one of the country's worst measles outbreaks in a decade. The US has seen more than 700 cases this year, a sharp rise on the 285 cases reported in 2024. The majority of infections - 541 as of Friday - occurred in western Texas, with 56 patients sent to the hospital. Cases in New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas also are linked to the outbreak. Two children, including Daisy, have died - the first recorded fatalities from measles in the US since 2015. It's not slowing down either, public health experts say. They try to reach vaccine-hesitant residents, but struggle with those who carry on with daily life as usual, alongside mixed messaging from federal officials, including Kennedy, who has endorsed immunisation conspiracy theories in the past. \"I wish there were more coming in to get the vaccine,\" Mr Holbrooks said. \"We can put messaging out, but it's up to them to come see us.\"\n\nThe South Plains public health director, Zach Holbrooks, is trying to reach vaccine-hesitant communities through messaging and public advertisements\n\n'Going about' life in a measles epicentre\n\nThe western Texas town of Seminole - population 7,000 - is bordered by miles of rural farmland and oil fields. Among billboards for restaurants, gun silencers and tractors, a digital sign hints at the crisis gripping the community: a warning about the dangers of measles, which can cause complications including pneumonia, brain swelling and death. It has spread rapidly among Mennonites, a religious community living near Seminole. Mr Holbrooks estimates the population could be as many as 40,000 across several counties. In those areas, public school vaccination rates are as low as 82%. Roughly 95% of a community must be vaccinated against the measles to achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease that its spread is limited and the unvaccinated are protected. Mr Holbrooks remembers when the Low German Mennonite group began migrating to his hometown and nearby states in the 1970s. The religion has no specific doctrines against vaccinations, but they tend to avoid many modern aspects of life, including the health care system. Their community is not alone. At least 118,000 kindergarteners in Texas are exempt from one or more vaccines, mostly in rural areas, according to Terri Burke, director of Texas vaccine advocacy group the Immunization Partnership. Parents can get a waiver to exempt their child from school vaccine requirements for a variety of reasons, including religion. Savannah Knelsen, an 18-year-old server at a Seminole barbecue restaurant, has not been vaccinated against measles - or anything else.\n\nLike many in Seminole, Jessica Giesbrecht (left) and Savannah Knelsen (right) have opposing views on vaccination\n\nMany of her family members and friends - also unvaccinated - caught the measles in recent weeks. One relative developed a fever of 104.5F (40.2C), but still chose not to go to the hospital. The recent deaths of two children have not convinced her to get vaccinated, she said, adding that she was healthy and wanted to let her body \"fight off\" infections. Experts agree the vaccine is the best way to prevent infections - including severe ones. Ms Knelsen's 19-year-old co-worker, Jessica Giesbrecht, along with her family, has been vaccinated against the measles. \"I'm worried for my baby niece,\" Ms Giesbrecht said, adding that she was too young to be vaccinated. Still, the two said the outbreak doesn't weigh heavily on daily life. Others in Seminole agree. A cashier at a local pharmacy said no one has stopped by for measles vaccinations since the outbreak started. \"People are just going about their lives,\" she said.\n\nTexas has had over 500 cases of measles, most concentrated in rural western counties\n\nKennedy tries to 'cover middle ground'\n\nOn Sunday, Kennedy made his first trip to the region since the outbreak to attend the eight-year-old girl's funeral. The top US health official is an unlikely figure to spearhead the fight against measles - having in the past endorsed conspiracy theories about immunisation, including debunked claims about links to autism. He downplayed the outbreak in western Texas at first, calling it \"not unusual\". Trump echoed these remarks last weekend, saying that only a \"fairly small number of people\" had been impacted, when he was asked about it by the BBC aboard Air Force One. It was \"not something new\", he added. On Wednesday, Kennedy gave his strongest statement yet in support of the measles vaccine, telling the BBC's US partner CBS News: \"The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine.\" The remarks were met with social media backlash from some anti-vaccine supporters. Kennedy added, however, that the government \"should not be mandating\" vaccines. The influence of some of his earlier remarks lingers. In one of several Mennonite-owned natural-health stores in Seminole, dozens of bottles of cod liver oil - a supplement that contains vitamin A - are on display. Alongside the vaccine, Kennedy has promoted vitamin A as an alternative measles treatment, a remedy doctors say should not be given without guidance from a physician and is no substitute for the vaccine.\n\nVitamin A is sometimes used to help treat measles - but should not be given without a physician's guidance\n\nThe treatment has at times proven dangerous. Covenant Children's Hospital in nearby Lubbock told the BBC it has treated several unvaccinated children with measles for vitamin A toxicity - some had attempted to use it as a preventative measure. The community needs federal officials to provide stronger messaging to help convince people to get vaccinated and slow the outbreak, said Gordon Mattimoe, director of the health department in nearby Andrews County. \"People look to their leaders to lead,\" he said. Jeff Hutt, a former spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee and Kennedy's former national field director, argued that the health secretary had to \"cover the middle ground\", providing statements that are \"politically adequate\" while also providing sceptical stances on vaccines. \"In covering the middle ground, I'm not necessarily sure he was able to reassure folks that he had a handle on [measles], or that he was able to reassure folks that he was sticking to his guns,\" Mr Hutt said.\n\nSlashing funds in an outbreak zone\n\nThe Trump administration's health policies could have other consequences in Texas, officials say. Local health departments are at risk of losing critical resources because of attempts to cut $11.4bn (\u00a38.8bn) in public health grants. The move was temporarily blocked by a judge last week. Mr Mattimoe said that because of the potential cuts - around $250,000 in grant funding for his health department - he is not able to hire a new nurse to give immunisations. In a statement to the BBC, the US Department of Health and Human Services said it had deployed the \"necessary\" resources from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to respond to the outbreak. \"The CDC is in close, constant communication with local and state health officials on the ground to ensure they have what they need,\" the official said. The Texas Department of Health Services could lose as much as $550m in grant funding. It has provided staff, vaccines, testing and other support to local health departments, but likely will need extra funding, spokesman Chris Van Deusen told the BBC. Mr Mattimoe contacted lawmakers and the state for help, but is not hopeful. \"I don't think they have the funds,\" he said.\n\n'Trusted messengers'\n\nLocal officials have seen some success in measles vaccination clinics, but hope even more will get vaccinated"

Local health departments are at risk of losing critical resources because of attempts to cut $11.4bn (\u00a38.8bn) in public health grants. The move was temporarily blocked by a judge last week. Mr Mattimoe said that because of the potential cuts - around $250,000 in grant funding for his health department - he is not able to hire a new nurse to give immunisations. In a statement to the BBC, the US Department of Health and Human Services said it had deployed the \"necessary\" resources from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to respond to the outbreak. \"The CDC is in close, constant communication with local and state health officials on the ground to ensure they have what they need,\" the official said. The Texas Department of Health Services could lose as much as $550m in grant funding. It has provided staff, vaccines, testing and other support to local health departments, but likely will need extra funding, spokesman Chris Van Deusen told the BBC. Mr Mattimoe contacted lawmakers and the state for help, but is not hopeful. \"I don't think they have the funds,\" he said.\n\n'Trusted messengers'\n\nLocal officials have seen some success in measles vaccination clinics, but hope even more will get vaccinated"

    "content": "Deadly measles outbreak does little to counter vaccine scepticism in Texas\n\n2 days ago Share Save Madeline Halpert BBC News Reporting from Western Texas Share Save\n\nHealth Secretary Robert Kennedy Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr traveled to be with the Mennonite community after a second child died of measles\n\nOn an unusually crisp April day in a rural Texas town, dozens of Mennonite community members gathered alongside the nation's top health official, Robert F Kennedy Jr, to mourn the death of an eight-year-old. Daisy Hildebrand is the second unvaccinated girl from the community to die from measles in two months. Officials in Seminole town also joined the reception after her funeral to support the family, said South Plains Public Health Director Zach Holbrooks. This time, there was no talk of the vaccine that prevents measles deaths - unlike many of his long days since the outbreak began. \"The focus was on their healing,\" Mr Holbrooks said. \"You never want to see anybody pass away, especially a child that young, from any kind of illness, because there is a prevention for it - the MMR vaccine.\" Like other Seminole natives, Mr Holbrooks was not vaccinated against measles as a child. He got a shot in college, and another in February, when his hometown became the epicentre of one of the country's worst measles outbreaks in a decade. The US has seen more than 700 cases this year, a sharp rise on the 285 cases reported in 2024. The majority of infections - 541 as of Friday - occurred in western Texas, with 56 patients sent to the hospital. Cases in New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas also are linked to the outbreak. Two children, including Daisy, have died - the first recorded fatalities from measles in the US since 2015. It's not slowing down either, public health experts say. They try to reach vaccine-hesitant residents, but struggle with those who carry on with daily life as usual, alongside mixed messaging from federal officials, including Kennedy, who has endorsed immunisation conspiracy theories in the past. \"I wish there were more coming in to get the vaccine,\" Mr Holbrooks said. \"We can put messaging out, but it's up to them to come see us.\"\n\nThe South Plains public health director, Zach Holbrooks, is trying to reach vaccine-hesitant communities through messaging and public advertisements\n\n'Going about' life in a measles epicentre\n\nThe western Texas town of Seminole - population 7,000 - is bordered by miles of rural farmland and oil fields. Among billboards for restaurants, gun silencers and tractors, a digital sign hints at the crisis gripping the community: a warning about the dangers of measles, which can cause complications including pneumonia, brain swelling and death. It has spread rapidly among Mennonites, a religious community living near Seminole. Mr Holbrooks estimates the population could be as many as 40,000 across several counties. In those areas, public school vaccination rates are as low as 82%. Roughly 95% of a community must be vaccinated against the measles to achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease that its spread is limited and the unvaccinated are protected. Mr Holbrooks remembers when the Low German Mennonite group began migrating to his hometown and nearby states in the 1970s. The religion has no specific doctrines against vaccinations, but they tend to avoid many modern aspects of life, including the health care system. Their community is not alone. At least 118,000 kindergarteners in Texas are exempt from one or more vaccines, mostly in rural areas, according to Terri Burke, director of Texas vaccine advocacy group the Immunization Partnership. Parents can get a waiver to exempt their child from school vaccine requirements for a variety of reasons, including religion. Savannah Knelsen, an 18-year-old server at a Seminole barbecue restaurant, has not been vaccinated against measles - or anything else.\n\nLike many in Seminole, Jessica Giesbrecht (left) and Savannah Knelsen (right) have opposing views on vaccination\n\nMany of her family members and friends - also unvaccinated - caught the measles in recent weeks. One relative developed a fever of 104.5F (40.2C), but still chose not to go to the hospital. The recent deaths of two children have not convinced her to get vaccinated, she said, adding that she was healthy and wanted to let her body \"fight off\" infections. Experts agree the vaccine is the best way to prevent infections - including severe ones. Ms Knelsen's 19-year-old co-worker, Jessica Giesbrecht, along with her family, has been vaccinated against the measles. \"I'm worried for my baby niece,\" Ms Giesbrecht said, adding that she was too young to be vaccinated. Still, the two said the outbreak doesn't weigh heavily on daily life. Others in Seminole agree. A cashier at a local pharmacy said no one has stopped by for measles vaccinations since the outbreak started. \"People are just going about their lives,\" she said.\n\nTexas has had over 500 cases of measles, most concentrated in rural western counties\n\nKennedy tries to 'cover middle ground'\n\nOn Sunday, Kennedy made his first trip to the region since the outbreak to attend the eight-year-old girl's funeral. The top US health official is an unlikely figure to spearhead the fight against measles - having in the past endorsed conspiracy theories about immunisation, including debunked claims about links to autism. He downplayed the outbreak in western Texas at first, calling it \"not unusual\". Trump echoed these remarks last weekend, saying that only a \"fairly small number of people\" had been impacted, when he was asked about it by the BBC aboard Air Force One. It was \"not something new\", he added. On Wednesday, Kennedy gave his strongest statement yet in support of the measles vaccine, telling the BBC's US partner CBS News: \"The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine.\" The remarks were met with social media backlash from some anti-vaccine supporters. Kennedy added, however, that the government \"should not be mandating\" vaccines. The influence of some of his earlier remarks lingers. In one of several Mennonite-owned natural-health stores in Seminole, dozens of bottles of cod liver oil - a supplement that contains vitamin A - are on display. Alongside the vaccine, Kennedy has promoted vitamin A as an alternative measles treatment, a remedy doctors say should not be given without guidance from a physician and is no substitute for the vaccine.\n\nVitamin A is sometimes used to help treat measles - but should not be given without a physician's guidance\n\nThe treatment has at times proven dangerous. Covenant Children's Hospital in nearby Lubbock told the BBC it has treated several unvaccinated children with measles for vitamin A toxicity - some had attempted to use it as a preventative measure. The community needs federal officials to provide stronger messaging to help convince people to get vaccinated and slow the outbreak, said Gordon Mattimoe, director of the health department in nearby Andrews County. \"People look to their leaders to lead,\" he said. Jeff Hutt, a former spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee and Kennedy's former national field director, argued that the health secretary had to \"cover the middle ground\", providing statements that are \"politically adequate\" while also providing sceptical stances on vaccines. \"In covering the middle ground, I'm not necessarily sure he was able to reassure folks that he had a handle on [measles], or that he was able to reassure folks that he was sticking to his guns,\" Mr Hutt said.\n\nSlashing funds in an outbreak zone\n\nThe Trump administration's health policies could have other consequences in Texas, officials say.

    "content": "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?\n\n4 days ago Share Save Liv McMahon Technology reporter Zoe Kleinman \u2022 @zsk Technology editor Share Save\n\nReuters\n\nThe world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US. Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy. The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars. And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.\n\nBen Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched. \"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US. Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK. And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device. While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025. \"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.\n\nWhere are iPhones made?\n\nThe US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research. It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India. Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years. India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs. As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days. Reuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US. Amid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost. The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.\n\nHow exposed is Apple to tariffs?\n\nTrump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing. However, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly. This, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat. Apple committed a $500bn (\u00a3385bn) investment in the US in February - which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing. But Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money. \"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" he wrote on X on 3 April.\n\nWill iPhone prices go up?\n\nApple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices. Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them. \"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee. But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash. \"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\" Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers. Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS. They estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046. While some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.\n\nWhat can consumers do about it?\n\nThere's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen. This hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones. The BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike. Anthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone. \"I really didn't need a phone... but I'm not ready to pay double the price,\" he said. Bruce Conroy, a hair stylist, told the BBC that even if prices had risen considerably he \"would have stuck with Apple products\" - though potentially delayed his purchase of a new iPad. \"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.\n\nJulia told the BBC she was expecting costs to rise across a wealth of areas, from groceries to gadgets\n\nWe will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost. But if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices. CCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market. The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost. The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions. \"The path of least resistance would be to keep the smartphone they already have for longer,\" said Mr Wood."

But Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money. \"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" he wrote on X on 3 April.\n\nWill iPhone prices go up?\n\nApple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices. Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them. \"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee. But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash. \"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\" Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers. Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS. They estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046. While some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.\n\nWhat can consumers do about it?\n\nThere's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen. This hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones. The BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike. Anthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone. \"I really didn't need a phone... but I'm not ready to pay double the price,\" he said. Bruce Conroy, a hair stylist, told the BBC that even if prices had risen considerably he \"would have stuck with Apple products\" - though potentially delayed his purchase of a new iPad. \"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.\n\nJulia told the BBC she was expecting costs to rise across a wealth of areas, from groceries to gadgets\n\nWe will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost. But if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices. CCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market. The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost. The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions. \"The path of least resistance would be to keep the smartphone they already have for longer,\" said Mr Wood."

    "content": "Can the US return man deported to El Salvador? Immigration lawyers think so\n\n5 days ago Share Save Kayla Epstein BBC News Share Save\n\nJennifer Vasquez Kilmar \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, who was sent to a prison in El Salvador during a Trump administration deportation initiative\n\nOn 12 March, Kilmar \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was driving home with his young son in Maryland when he was stopped by agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Agents took Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda into custody, then shuttled him to detention facilities in Louisiana and Texas. According to a federal judge, after three days, \"without any notice, legal process, or hearing\", Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda found himself back in his native El Salvador at an infamous prison known for housing gang members. The government said he was deported due to an \"administrative error\". But despite that, Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda remains incarcerated in El Salvador as lawyers debate the unusual intricacies of the case. A Maryland court ordered Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda be returned to the US, but Trump officials argued that they cannot compel El Salvador to return Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda. The administration also argued that the judge ordering his return lacked the authority to do so. On Monday, the Supreme Court put a temporary hold on lower court orders while they consider the matter. Immigration experts say that as US President Donald Trump takes a hardline approach on illegal immigration, this case has the potential to upend due process for immigrants. \"If the US Supreme Court were to accept [the Trump administration's] position, it would completely eviscerate any rule of law in the immigration process,\" Maureen Sweeney, director of the University of Maryland's Chac\u00f3n Center for Immigrant Justice, told the BBC. \"Because they could pick up anybody, at any time, and send them anywhere with no repercussions whatsoever.\"\n\nThe Trump administration pushes back\n\nUS District Judge Paula Xinis wrote in a filing Sunday that ICE officials did not follow procedures in the Immigration and Nationality Act when they deported Mr Garcia to El Salvador. She ruled the US must bring him back before midnight on Monday. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, writing that the US \"has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street\". Yet the Trump administration has argued that it cannot comply, saying Judge Xinis' filing is outside her jurisdiction. \"Neither a federal district court nor the United States has authority to tell the Government of El Salvador what to do,\" US Solicitor General D John Sauer wrote in an appeal to the Supreme Court. Judge rules US must return man deported to El Salvador in 'error'\n\nUS judge scolds Trump officials for failing to return man deported in error\n\nUS Supreme Court pauses order requiring return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia Nicole Hallett, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School said that while it is true - US district judges cannot order El Salvador to take action - they can order the US government to have Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda returned. She also said the US has previously facilitated the return of mistakenly deported individuals. Prof Hallett also questioned the government's claim that the US is powerless to compel El Salvador to release Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, citing an agreement between the two countries. The US, under the Trump administration, paid El Salvador's government $6m to house prisoners it sends, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Top officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump himself have publicly touted the arrangement. \"It's almost as if the Salvadoran government is acting as an agent of the US government,\" Ms Hallett said, arguing that this makes the release more plausible. Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's lawyers argued that because El Salvador was detaining Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda \"at the direct request and pursuant to financial compensation\" from the US, the court could order the US government to request his return. The Department of Justice, however, has resisted calls to take such action. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday that \"it was an administrative error as to why he was deported,\" but maintained the allegation that Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda belonged to a gang. \"We believe he should stay where he is,\" she said.\n\nWatch: 'I miss you so much', says wife of Salvadoran deported by mistake\n\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda is among 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans deported under the Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison. Officials allege they are gang members and therefore are subject to deportation. Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, who is married to a US citizen, does not have any gang ties and has never been charged with a crime, his lawyer says. He was also protected by a \"withholding of removal\" order, which means the US government cannot send him back to El Salvador because he could face harm. The order dates back to 2019, when ICE first took Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda into custody and alleged he belonged to the MS-13 criminal organisation, an allegation he denied at the time. Such orders are common, immigration lawyers told the BBC, and are an alternative to asylum protections. \"It was an unlawful act, for the US to return him to the country where he could not be returned,\" said Amelia Wilson, director of the Immigration Justice Clinic at Pace University. A judge ultimately granted Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda the 2019 order after he \"testified about how he was a victim of gang violence in El Salvador when he was a teenager and he came to the US to escape all of that,\" his wife, Jennifer V\u00e1squez Sura, wrote in a March 2025 affidavit. Department of Justice attorney Erez Reuveni acknowledged that at the time the \"government did not appeal that decision, so it is final\". The Trump administration now reiterates allegations that Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda belonged to MS-13, but Judge Xinis said the government made this claim \"without any evidence\" and had not produced a removal order or warrant.\n\nSupreme Court showdown looms"

The BBC's Adam Fleming explains\n\nIn a growing trade war, US President Donald Trump has placed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods. China has hit back with 125% on US products. Trump has also introduced a 10% tax on goods from the vast majority of other countries, while pausing much higher rates for dozens of nations for 90 days. He argues that tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, but the world economy has been thrown into chaos and prices are expected to rise.\n\nWhat are tariffs and how do they work?\n\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods bought from other countries. Typically, they are a percentage of a product's value. The 10% tariff on goods from most nations means a $10 product would have a $1 tax on top - taking the total cost to $11 (\u00a38.35). The 145% charge on some Chinese goods would take the cost of a $10 product to $24.50 (\u00a318.60). Companies that bring foreign goods into the US have to pay the tax to the government. They may pass some or all of the increased cost on to customers. Follow live: Trump suggests tariff exemption for China-made smartphones could be short-lived\n\nTrump steps back from cliff edge of global trade war\n\nWhy is Trump using tariffs?\n\nTrump says tariffs will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and lead to huge levels of investment in the country. He wants to reduce the gap between the value of goods the US buys from other countries and those it sells to them. He argues that America has been taken advantage of by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners. The US president has made other demands alongside tariffs. The first announced during his current term targeted China, Mexico and Canada, after he said he wanted them to do more to stop migrants and illegal drugs reaching the US. Trump has strongly defended his tariffs policy but influential voices within his Republican Party have joined opposition Democrats and foreign leaders in attacking the measures. Why Beijing is not backing down on tariffs\n\nIs the US making $2bn a day from tariffs?\n\nReuters China now produces 60% of the world's electric cars \u2013 a large proportion of them made by its own homegrown brands\n\nWhat has Trump announced on tariffs?\n\nSince Trump's inauguration in January there has been a flurry of announcements on tariffs, with other countries scrambling to respond. Mexico and Canada: Canada and Mexico were targeted by Trump back in February during an earlier round of raised tariffs. The president announced a 25% tax on exports from both countries to the US and a 10% levy on Canadian energy. There have since been a number of exemptions and delays. Trump's \"baseline\" 10% rate does not apply to them. Steel and aluminium: A 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US, including products made from these metals took effect on 12 March. Cars: The White House announced in March that 25% duties on cars would apply from 2 April. A similar 25% levy on car parts is due to come in by 3 May. Higher tariffs paused: Tariffs on roughly 60 countries, which were described by the US president as the \"worst offenders\", were introduced on 9 April. Trump then announced a 90-day pause, during which the 10% \"baseline\" rate will be paid, excluding China. China: A 10% tariff on goods from China to the US was unveiled in February - alongside the taxes on products from Mexico and Canada. Tariffs for China have since increased to 125%. However, for some Chinese products taxes will be set at 145%, due to a previous 20% levy for those producing the drug fentanyl. China put tariffs on US imports at 125% from 12 April and has said it will not respond to any further US increases because they will become a \"joke\". Smartphones and computers: An exemption for some electronic devices including smartphones and computers, backdated to 5 April, was announced on 12 April. But Trump then said exemptions for technology from China could be short lived. BBC Verify: How were Donald Trump's tariffs calculated?\n\nHow much trade is there between the US and China?\n\nThe US currently runs a trade deficit with China. In 2024, the US imported far more from China ($440bn) than Beijing imported from America ($145bn). In his first term as president, Trump imposed significant tariffs on China, which were retained and expanded by his successor Joe Biden. Together those trade barriers helped to reduce the amount the US bought from China from 21% of America's total imports in 2016 to 13% in 2024. However, China still ships everything from iPhones to children's toys to the US. Analysts have pointed out that some Chinese goods enter the US via neighbouring South East Asian countries, which could mean they can avoid the tariffs of up to 145% Why Trump is hitting China on trade - and what might happen next\n\nWhat would a US-China trade war do to the world economy?\n\nWill prices go up for US consumers?\n\nMany economists expect tariffs to push up prices across a range of imported goods, as firms pass on some or all of their increased costs. The products affected could include everything from clothing to coffee and alcohol to electronics. Some firms may also decide to import fewer foreign goods, which could make those that are available more expensive. The price of goods manufactured in the US using imported components may also rise. For example, car parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.\n\nCar prices had already been expected to increase as a result of earlier tariffs, which remain in place. The cost of a car made using parts from Mexico and Canada alone could rise by $4,000-$10,000 (\u00a33,035 - \u00a37,588) depending on the vehicle, according to analysts at the Anderson Economic Group.\n\nWhat has happened to stock markets?\n\nTrump's tariffs announcements have caused significant volatility on global stock markets. Stock markets are where firms sell shares in their business. They reflect the best guess of what every company in the world is worth and what their future profits will be. Many people are affected by stock market price falls, even if they don't invest in shares directly, because of the knock-on effect on pensions, jobs and interest rates. How does it affect me if share prices fall?\n\nStocks, tariffs and pensions - your questions answered\n\nHow will Trump's tariffs affect the UK?\n\nPA Media\n\nThe UK exported around \u00a358bn of goods to the US in 2024, mainly cars, machinery and pharmaceuticals. It was already due to be affected by the earlier tariffs targeting steel, aluminium and car imports. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said \"clearly there will be an economic impact\" from the 10% tariff. The UK is looking to negotiate a trade deal to soften the 10% tariffs, but one of President Trump's advisers suggests any such deal would have to be \"extraordinary\". The UK government has so far not announced any taxes on US imports. However, it is drawing up a list of US products it could hit with retaliatory tariffs.\n\nFollowing the announcement of tariffs, carmaker Jaguar Land Rover said it would \"pause\" all shipments to the US as it worked to \"address the new trading terms\". Economists have warned US tariffs could knock the UK's economy off course and make it harder for the government to hit its borrowing rules.

But the impact of the lower rate remains a serious concern for them. The European Union is among those seeking a trade deal with the US during this 90-day higher tariff pause. The bloc is also \"developing retaliatory measures\" in case talks fail, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has said. Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk urged all parties to \"make the best\" of the 90 day pause, stressing that maintaining strong relations with the US \"is a common responsibility of Europeans and Americans\". Germany's incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the pause proves a united European approach to trade has a positive effect, adding: \"Europeans are determined to defend ourselves\". Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Ho Duc Phoc said the US and Vietnam expect to start \"negotiations on a bilateral trade agreement\", which \"would include tariff agreements\".

    "content": "Sudan\u2019s information blackout has left relatives of those in Sudan\u2019s Zamzam refugee camp struggling for news of their safety after it was overrun by militiamen at the weekend.\n\nAs leaders across the globe prepared to meet for peace talks in London to pressure the backers of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese army to agree a ceasefire, the RSF launched a deadly assault, seizing Zamzam after weeks of tightening its siege.\n\nThe UN\u2019s migration agency, the IOM, said between 60,000 and 80,000 households had been displaced from Zamzam following the attacks. The medical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said its team at Tawila, another displacement camp near El Fasher in Darfur, had seen about 10,000 people arrive in 48 hours suffering from dehydration and exhaustion.\n\nCampaigners said the dearth of information on the violence, which has reportedly killed hundreds of civilians, highlighted the need for the London talks to prioritise restoring communications to allow communities under attack to warn each other, to give better access to healthcare and to facilitate human rights documentation.\n\nAltahir Hashim, whose family was living in Zamzam, said: \u201cZamzam as an IDP [internally displaced persons] camp no longer exists. The RSF has completely overrun the camp \u2013 killing, raping, burning and committing all kinds of atrocities. The communications are really bad and I haven\u2019t been able to speak to my family.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen A satellite photo of Zamzam camp of the damage after the RSF attack and, below, as it was in January. The RSF killed more than 200 people. Photograph: Maxar Technologies /AFP/Getty\n\nOn Friday, nine medical workers from the aid organisation Relief International were killed when the RSF raided Zamzam, while the Sudanese American Physicians Association (Sapa), said the manager of a children\u2019s health centre was also killed.\n\nFor two decades Zamzam has hosted people displaced during the 2000s in attacks by the army and the Janjaweed militias \u2013 who were later formalised into the RSF \u2013 but its population has grown to about 700,000 during the current civil war as people have fled other parts of the Darfur region.\n\nHashim is part of a group of Darfuris abroad who have raised funds to buy and airdrop satellite phones into Darfur as well as walkie-talkies to allow local communication during emergencies.\n\nHe said the communications blackout also made it difficult for people to receive money sent from relatives abroad through mobile banking systems.\n\nView image in fullscreen People who fled Zamzam camp, after it fell under RSF control, rest near Tawila. The camp\u2019s population grew to about 700,000 during the civil war. Photograph: AFP/Getty\n\nThe limited information that has emerged from Zamzam has often relied on satellite communications \u2013 whether through imagery, phones or the Starlink service, which uses satellites rather than land-based communication towers to provide internet.\n\nBut these services can be unreliable and are costly, meaning that while they are used by some activists in Darfur, others remain unable to be contacted.\n\nOne video shared by the group North Darfur Observatory for Human Rights showed people fleeing Zamzam with their belongings strapped to camels and donkeys.\n\n2:16 Footage shows people fleeing Zamzam with their belongings strapped to camels and donkeys \u2013 video\n\nOften the main source of information from Darfur has come from videos recorded by RSF fighters themselves of the atrocities and some have emerged showing their fighters entering Zamzam on pickup trucks mounted with heavy machine guns with burning buildings in the background.\n\nShayna Lewis, from the US-based organisation Preventing & Ending Mass Atrocities (Paema).\u201cWe have reports of civilians being hunted and executed in the streets of Zamzam, but we are unable to consistently communicate with people as the networks are off and the internet can only be accessed through Starlink access points. Starlink access is sporadic, expensive and can be turned off by the belligerents at will.\u201d\n\nPaema said the talks in London should prioritise restoring communications as a way to quickly relieve suffering in Sudan.\n\nSapa, which operates medical facilities in El Fasher, said the last message it received from its teams in Zamzam on Sunday afternoon was: \u201cZamzam under the control of the RSF.\u201d\n\nKhalid Mishain, of the Sudanese human rights group Youth Citizens Observers Network, said they had lost contact with their observers in the area since the attack. He said the communications blackout had been a impediment to human rights documentation throughout the conflict.\n\n\u201cPeople have to write the information down, keep it with them and then secretly move to areas where there is communications and send it to us,\u201d said Mishain.\n\n\u201cWe have civilians suffering and no one knows about it, and those who report on it have to risk their life because of the communications blackout.\u201d"

But for several tiny countries, their key exports are agricultural commodities, for which the US is unlikely to be able to find substitutes elsewhere \u2013 let alone develop a domestic industry.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As many as 32 countries were eligible, before Trump\u2019s announcement appeared to tear up the scheme.\n\nFinancial markets and manufacturers in developing countries are continuing to wrestle with the changeable nature of US trade policy.\n\nTrump sowed fresh confusion over the weekend by appearing to revisit an announcement made on Friday, that some hi-tech goods, including laptops, would be exempt from tariffs.\n\nIn a post on his social media site Truth Social on Sunday, the president said no one was getting \u201coff the hook\u201d, and the administration would be investigating the \u201cwhole electronics supply chain\u201d."

    "content": "The UN\u2019s trade and development arm, Unctad, is calling on Donald Trump to exempt the world\u2019s poorest and smallest countries from \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, or risk \u201cserious economic harm\u201d.\n\nIn a report published on Monday, Unctad identifies 28 nations the US president singled out for a higher tariff rate than the 10% baseline \u2013 despite each accounting for less than 0.1% of the US trade deficit.\n\nThese include Laos, which is expected to face a 48% tariff; Mauritius, on 40%; and Myanmar, to be hit with 45%, despite trying to recover from a devastating earthquake.\n\nThe White House shocked many developing countries with the punitive tariff rates announced this month.\n\nTrump claimed rival economies had \u201clooted, pillaged, raped, plundered\u201d the US with unfair trade practices, and he wanted to create a level playing field.\n\nUnctad said many of the countries targeted with high tariff rates were unlikely to be a threat to the world\u2019s largest economy, given their small size and modest levels of exports.\n\nThe White House last week put the higher tariff rates on pause for 90 days, after unleashing chaos on world financial markets, leaving a 10% levy in place across the board.\n\nBut the administration\u2019s formal position remains that the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff rates will come into force, subject to negotiations.\n\n\u201cThe current 90-day pause presents an opportunity to reassess how small and vulnerable economies \u2013 including the least developed countries \u2013 are treated,\u201d Unctad said.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical moment to consider exempting them from tariffs that offer little to no advantage for US trade policy but risk causing serious economic harm.\u201d\n\nUnctad\u2019s analysis said many of these economies were so small that they were likely to generate little demand for US exports, even if they lowered tariffs, as the White House appears to be demanding.\n\nMalawi, facing 18% tariffs, bought just $27m of US exports last year; Mozambique, which faces 16% tariffs, $150m; Cambodia, set for 49% tariffs, $322m.\n\nUnctad\u2019s experts added that 36 of these small and poor countries were likely to generate less than 1% of total US tariff revenue, even if the US did not cut imports from them as the tariffs took effect.\n\nPart of the logic of the tariff policy is meant to be to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US. But for several tiny countries, their key exports are agricultural commodities, for which the US is unlikely to be able to find substitutes elsewhere \u2013 let alone develop a domestic industry.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As many as 32 countries were eligible, before Trump\u2019s announcement appeared to tear up the scheme.\n\nFinancial markets and manufacturers in developing countries are continuing to wrestle with the changeable nature of US trade policy.\n\nTrump sowed fresh confusion over the weekend by appearing to revisit an announcement made on Friday, that some hi-tech goods, including laptops, would be exempt from tariffs.\n\nIn a post on his social media site Truth Social on Sunday, the president said no one was getting \u201coff the hook\u201d, and the administration would be investigating the \u201cwhole electronics supply chain\u201d."

    "content": "An estimated 1 million Gabonese citizens head to the polls on Saturday to vote in the country\u2019s first presidential election since an August 2023 coup ended the 55-year Bongo family dynasty. For Brice Nguema, the junta leader turned civilian head of state, it could be a chance to cement his democratic credentials.\n\nLast November, 860,000 registered voters approved a referendum for a new constitution with two seven-year presidential terms and an amnesty for participants in the removal of Ali Bongo, who had succeeded his father in 2009. Officials are yet to release data on the updated voters\u2019 register but previously said they expected an additional 300,000 new registrations, including from those who have recently come of age.\n\nObserver missions are already in place, including that of an eight-person Commonwealth team led by Danny Faure, a former president of Seychelles.\n\nFour independents are in the race for president but analysts say the favourite is Nguema. Since coming to power, 50-year-old Nguema has styled himself as an anti-corruption crusader who had to resort to a coup to end an unpopular family dynasty, despite also being a cousin to Bongo. In October 2023, he made headlines for reportedly refusing to draw a salary for the presidency.\n\nThose announcements drew plaudits in the oil-rich central African state where a third of the 2.3 million people live in poverty.\n\n\u201cGabonese tell themselves that someone who works with this much ardour is trying to transform things,\u201d Joseph Tonda, a sociologist at Omar Bongo University in Libreville, told Reuters news agency earlier this month.\n\nBut like his cousin, Nguema has maintained close ties with France even in the face of high anti-French sentiments in the region. And a 2020 investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) revealed multimillion-dollar assets abroad, believed to be the proceeds of embezzlement during his time in the presidential guard.\n\nHis closest challenger is the ex-prime minister Alain Claude Bilie By Nze, who was in government until the coup. Nze, who has campaigned as a pragmatic veteran seeking to create jobs and reduce the size of government, has also tried to dissociate himself from the old guard.\n\nOther candidates include the former tax official Joseph Lapens\u00e9e Essingone and St\u00e9phane Germain Iloko, previously a member of the former ruling Gabonese Democratic party (PDG).\n\nThe coup, one of a string of military takeovers in west and central Africa between 2020 and 2023, was well received in Gabon, with many citizens trooping to the streets of Port Gentil and Libreville, its two biggest cities.\n\nBut there are concerns that Nguema may also be using the same Bongo playbook of muzzling dissent.\n\nIn particular, the Union for Democracy and Social Integration (UDIS) party \u2013 once allied with the former ruling party \u2013 has accused the administration of targeting its exiled leader, Herv\u00e9 Patrick Opiangah, who is the subject of a criminal investigation for alleged incest and undermining state security.\n\nOpiangah, 54, a former mining minister, has proclaimed his innocence and filed a complaint with the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights.\n\nEdmond Ngadi, a UDIS spokesperson who has called the matter a \u201cstate conspiracy\u201d, said Opiangah was being targeted for mobilising for people to vote no during the 16 November referendum.\n\n\u201cThis is a blatant violation of human rights \u2026 he is a Gabonese citizen who simply asks to return to his country safely to be able to secure his family, secure his businesses and also participate in the life of his country,\u201d Ngadi said."

    "content": "Campaigners with Canada\u2019s Liberal party had some very American-esque politicking over the weekend, when Liberal operatives were found to have planted \u201cstop the steal\u201d buttons at a conservative conference to link the Conservative party to Donald Trump.\n\nTwo Liberal party staffers infiltrated last week\u2019s Canada Strong and Free Network Conference (CSFN) in Ottawa at which they strategically placed provocative buttons designed to create the false impression that Conservative supporters of party leader Pierre Poilievre were embracing Trump-style rhetoric, highlighting internal party divisions.\n\nThe operation was exposed when a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) politics reporter overheard staffers boasting about their actions at an Ottawa pub, where they were drinking with other Liberal war room colleagues on Friday night.\n\nOne button featured the phrase \u201cstop the steal\u201d \u2013 directly echoing Trump\u2019s baseless claims about the 2020 election results being stolen from him. Another displayed the name of Conservative national campaign director, Jenni Byrne, crossed out, with \u201cKory Teneycke\u201d written underneath \u2013 referring to a leading Conservative strategist who has been publicly bashing Poilievre.\n\nThe CSFN conference, Canada\u2019s less idealistic version of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), serves as a key gathering for conservative-minded Canadians to discuss policy proposals and network.\n\nThe incident comes in the final stretch of a heated campaign only weeks away from elections, in which the Liberals who hold a polling lead have consistently sought to characterize Poilievre as Canada\u2019s version of Trump.\n\nPoilievre\u2019s confrontational style with mainstream media, his \u201cCanada First\u201d campaign slogan, and his frequent attacks on the CBC specifically as \u201cgovernment-funded media\u201d have fueled these comparisons, despite his insistence on fundamental differences between himself and the US president. Just this Sunday on Radio-Canada\u2019s popular talkshow Tout le monde en parle, when asked if he was a \u201cmini-Trump, medium Trump or large Trump\u201d, Poilievre quipped about his lighter weight before emphasizing his \u201ccompletely different story\u201d as the child of middle-class teachers compared with the US president\u2019s inherited wealth.\n\nThe Liberal party confirmed the incident on Sunday evening, saying some campaigners had \u201cregrettably got carried away\u201d with buttons \u201cpoking fun\u201d at reported Conservative infighting. A party spokesperson, Kevin Lemkay, added that the Liberal leader, Mark Carney, had made it clear \u201cthis does not fit his commitment to serious and positive discourse\u201d.\n\nOver the years, Poilievre has proudly associated himself as a culture warrior for Canada\u2019s right, saying he wants the country to move away from \u201cwoke\u201d to \u201cwarrior\u201d and appearing on rightwing media like the Canadian influencer Jordan Peterson\u2019s show.\n\nThe Liberal party has been able to take advantage of linking Poilievre to Trump after near country-wide disappointment and disapproval that followed the US president\u2019s targeting of Canada as the supposed \u201c51st state\u201d and choosing to include its previously friendly neighbor in mass tariffs. As a result, there has been a near-total plunge in Canadian tourism to the United States, and the Liberals hold a tight lead in the polls under new leader Carney.\n\n\u201cDespite their public claims, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s the Liberals who are attempting to bring American-style politics to our country,\u201d the Conservative party spokesperson, Sam Lilly, said in a statement to CBC."

    "content": "Campaigners with Canada\u2019s Liberal party had some very American-esque politicking over the weekend, when Liberal operatives were found to have planted \u201cstop the steal\u201d buttons at a conservative conference to link the Conservative party to Donald Trump.\n\nTwo Liberal party staffers infiltrated last week\u2019s Canada Strong and Free Network Conference (CSFN) in Ottawa at which they strategically placed provocative buttons designed to create the false impression that Conservative supporters of party leader Pierre Poilievre were embracing Trump-style rhetoric, highlighting internal party divisions.\n\nThe operation was exposed when a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) politics reporter overheard staffers boasting about their actions at an Ottawa pub, where they were drinking with other Liberal war room colleagues on Friday night.\n\nOne button featured the phrase \u201cstop the steal\u201d \u2013 directly echoing Trump\u2019s baseless claims about the 2020 election results being stolen from him. Another displayed the name of Conservative national campaign director, Jenni Byrne, crossed out, with \u201cKory Teneycke\u201d written underneath \u2013 referring to a leading Conservative strategist who has been publicly bashing Poilievre.\n\nThe CSFN conference, Canada\u2019s less idealistic version of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), serves as a key gathering for conservative-minded Canadians to discuss policy proposals and network.\n\nThe incident comes in the final stretch of a heated campaign only weeks away from elections, in which the Liberals who hold a polling lead have consistently sought to characterize Poilievre as Canada\u2019s version of Trump.\n\nPoilievre\u2019s confrontational style with mainstream media, his \u201cCanada First\u201d campaign slogan, and his frequent attacks on the CBC specifically as \u201cgovernment-funded media\u201d have fueled these comparisons, despite his insistence on fundamental differences between himself and the US president. Just this Sunday on Radio-Canada\u2019s popular talkshow Tout le monde en parle, when asked if he was a \u201cmini-Trump, medium Trump or large Trump\u201d, Poilievre quipped about his lighter weight before emphasizing his \u201ccompletely different story\u201d as the child of middle-class teachers compared with the US president\u2019s inherited wealth.\n\nThe Liberal party confirmed the incident on Sunday evening, saying some campaigners had \u201cregrettably got carried away\u201d with buttons \u201cpoking fun\u201d at reported Conservative infighting. A party spokesperson, Kevin Lemkay, added that the Liberal leader, Mark Carney, had made it clear \u201cthis does not fit his commitment to serious and positive discourse\u201d.\n\nOver the years, Poilievre has proudly associated himself as a culture warrior for Canada\u2019s right, saying he wants the country to move away from \u201cwoke\u201d to \u201cwarrior\u201d and appearing on rightwing media like the Canadian influencer Jordan Peterson\u2019s show.\n\nThe Liberal party has been able to take advantage of linking Poilievre to Trump after near country-wide disappointment and disapproval that followed the US president\u2019s targeting of Canada as the supposed \u201c51st state\u201d and choosing to include its previously friendly neighbor in mass tariffs. As a result, there has been a near-total plunge in Canadian tourism to the United States, and the Liberals hold a tight lead in the polls under new leader Carney.\n\n\u201cDespite their public claims, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s the Liberals who are attempting to bring American-style politics to our country,\u201d the Conservative party spokesperson, Sam Lilly, said in a statement to CBC."

    "content": "Sky-high tariffs that now hang heavily over US-China trade mean, effectively, that they have declared a trade embargo on each other, normally an act of war. The economic consequences for both will hurt.\n\nThe US\u2019s $150bn (\u00a3113bn) or so of exports to China will fall away quickly, while China\u2019s $440bn worth of exports to the US may drop by up to 75% over the next 18 months, unless some sort of negotiation happens. No one will be spared the effects.\n\nThe consequences could tip the US into a mild recession this summer, and are undermining one of the country\u2019s principal weapons, namely the power, leverage and reach of its financial system. The leading indicators of consumer confidence, inflation, and capital spending are all flashing warning signs. It is also an ill wind that last week brought both rising bond yields in the US Treasury market and a falling dollar.\n\nThis trade war is distinctly unwelcome for the Chinese Communist party, which only last month revealed its alarm at the underlying fragility of China\u2019s economy. Chinese exports were on fire last year, accounting for half of its growth and expanding three times as fast as world trade. The country ran a $2tn trade surplus in manufactured goods. The government can ill-afford a trade torpedo as it tries to stabilise its beleaguered property sector, along with debt and asset deflation in local governments, and finance.\n\nTrade negotiations would not be a panacea for the fundamental issues that divide these two powers, but they might \u2026 at least keep dialogue going.\n\nDonald Trump and Xi Jinping boast resilience and determination, but have reasons to pull back, if not call off, the trade dogs of war. The chances of immediate rapprochement look poor, but not hopeless. China\u2019s ministry of commerce said over the weekend it would ignore future US escalation. The US announced tariff exemptions for smartphones, chips, and electronic equipment, though only temporarily. Some sort of eventual transactional \u201cdeal\u201d \u2013 some rollback of high tariffs, maybe TikTok, other issues \u2013 still seems probable.\n\nThe US wants to contain and decouple from China, but has not as yet exercised some of its more potent financial and export control weapons. China has been pursuing decoupling under the slogan of self-reliance for a long time, and if Xi wanted to, he could shut down any chance of talks by devaluing the yuan much more aggressively, and targeting a swathe of US firms.\n\nTrade negotiations would not be a panacea for the fundamental issues that divide these two powers, but they might buy some time and at least keep dialogue going.\n\nImplications for the rest of the world were hinted at, curiously, by the crisis surrounding British Steel and its Chinese owner, Jingye Group. Seemingly a world away, there is though an important connection. In the firm\u2019s UK and French plants, Jingye has been able to make, finish and export steel, branding it \u201cMade in UK\u201d and so avoid steel tariffs and other trade restrictions when selling to the EU and US.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About a quarter of all China\u2019s exports are now trans-shipped. US so-called \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d on more than 100 countries, with the top tariffs applying in Asia, were designed partly to stop this from happening.\n\nThe recently announced 90-day pause in these tariffs (ex-China) were both a reaction to stabilise the US\u2019s battered financial markets, but also a window in which the US hopes that several important countries will negotiate new trade arrangements with Washington, possibly including restrictions on trade and investment with China.\n\nThe EU and the UK appear now in \u201cpause\u201d mode with respect to retaliation, formal channels have opened with Japan and South Korea, and the US reports encouraging signals from Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and India, for example. It is a complicated picture. Many countries are highly integrated into China\u2019s trading system, but many have also implemented trade measures against China to protect their own manufacturing, jobs and communities. No one wants to lose access to the US consumer market, which is 30% of the world total. China\u2019s mercantilist character means it will not and cannot fill the gap, and wants only to expand its exports.\n\nThe manner in which the Trump administration is prosecuting this trade war is chaotic and often barely thought out. Yet, it is important not to lose sight of the reason that trade conflict has erupted in the first place, and that is as reaction to China\u2019s surging trade surplus. This comes from a political system that gives exceptionally large support to its companies, distorts competition, restricts market access and imposes real economic costs on other nations. Caveat emptor.\n\nGeorge Magnus is a research associate at Oxford University\u2019s China Centre and at Soas University of London. He is the author of Red Flags: Why Xi\u2019s China is in Jeopardy."

The tariff, which has been paused, threatens to devastate the country\u2019s ambitious economic growth plan.\n\nXi\u2019s visit was reportedly planned prior to Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. During meetings Vietnam and China will sign about 40 agreements across different sectors, Vietnam\u2019s deputy prime minister, B\u00f9i Thanh S\u01a1n, said on Saturday. It is expected this will include cooperation to develop Vietnam\u2019s railway network.\n\nVietnam\u2019s leader, T\u00f4 L\u00e2m, wrote in an article published in state media on Monday that Hanoi wanted to boost cooperation in defence, security and infrastructure, especially on rail links.\n\nXi\u2019s visit will probably form part of an effort to prevent economic encirclement by the US and in the region, said Dr Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at the Vietnam studies programme of the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, who cited reports that Washington would prioritise trade negotiations with countries such as Vietnam, Japan, South Korea and India.\n\nFor Vietnam, Giang added, Xi\u2019s visit presented \u201ca risk and an opportunity\u201d.\n\nVietnam, and many other south-east Asian countries, are trying to maintain a delicate balancing act between the US and China. The US is Vietnam\u2019s main export market, with US exports accounting for 30% of Vietnam\u2019s GDP. However, China is Vietnam\u2019s top import source, which it relies on for raw materials and other supplies that will be used to produce exports destined for the US.\n\nVietnam has traditionally sought to avoid taking sides between the US and China and will want to avoid antagonising either party, especially as it tries to persuade Washington to lower tariffs.\n\nVietnam is vulnerable to Washington\u2019s tariffs because its trade surplus with the US has grown rapidly over recent years to more than $123bn (\u00a394bn), fuelled in part by companies relocating production to Vietnam to avoid tariffs imposed on China by the last Trump administration.\n\nHanoi is preparing to crack down on Chinese goods being shipped from its territory to the US, in an effort to appease Washington, according to a Reuters report, and to tighten controls on sensitive exports to China. It has also made other concessions, including offering to remove all tariffs on US imports and promising to buy more US goods.\n\nCambodia and Malaysia, which face tariffs of 49% and 24% respectively, are also seeking to negotiate with Donald Trump, while China has previously vowed to \u201cfight until the end\u201d if the US continued to escalate the trade war.\n\nHanoi will want to avoid being seen as moving too close to Beijing during Xi\u2019s visit, given the tension between China and Washington, said Giang, but he added that China may be able to offer a \u201clife-saving opportunity for Vietnamese economy \u2026 at least in the short run\u201d.\n\nThis could include a commitment from China not to export its excess capacity to Vietnam. Across many south-east Asian countries there is concern that tariffs imposed on China by the US will worsen a problem of cheap Chinese goods overwhelming domestic industries. China could also increase its imports from south-east Asia, including in areas such as agriculture.\n\nA willingness to pursue peaceful solutions to the dispute in the South China Sea, where Beijing and several south-east Asian countries have overlapping claims, would also improve perceptions of China in the region, added Giang.\n\n\u201cNow we are viewing the US as a global disruptor \u2013 that presents China a golden opportunity to be a responsible stakeholder in the region. And if they can do so, I think more and more south-east Asian countries will eventually move closer to China,\u201d Giang said."

The couple\u2019s son, a university academic, lives in Hong Kong, and they were visiting to see their three-month-old grandson.\n\n\u201cAnd at the end of about three hours, my husband was told he was free to go but I was denied entry, and I was going to go back on the next plane home,\u201d Hobhouse said.\n\nThe Bath MP said that while she tried to be \u201ccooperative and friendly\u201d in the expectation she would eventually be allowed in, on being told she could not, she \u201cslightly lost it\u201d and demanded an explanation, but was told only: \u201cWe are so sorry, Madam, we understand.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cNo explanation was given to me, ever. And this is what is so chilling, and should really be a wake-up call for any parliamentarian, because I had no warning that I was on the blacklist.\u201d\n\nChina has in the past publicly banned several British MPs from entering the country, including Iain Duncan Smith and Nusrat Ghani who, like Hobhouse, are members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac).\n\nIpac is an international group of politicians that scrutinises Beijing\u2019s approach to human rights and has criticised the crackdown on free speech in Hong Kong.\n\nHobhouse said her apparent presence on \u201ca sort of hidden blacklist\u201d appeared likely to be connected to her membership of Ipac.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a member of Ipac,\u201d she said. \u201cIpac is watching the human rights adherence, or not, of the Chinese Communist party, but I\u2019m not more outspoken than other MPs about criticising the Chinese Communist party.\n\n\u201cTherefore anybody who ultimately is seen as standing up for freedom, democracy and human rights should feel that they are going to be targeted by the Chinese authorities. And that is really, really chilling.\u201d\n\nAsked how she felt personally about not being able to see her grandchild, Hobhouse said it was \u201cdepressing\u201d. She said: \u201cThere are many, many more tragedies that are far, far worse, but I am sad.\u201d\n\nAsked about Hobhouse\u2019s case by Sky, Murray said: \u201cWe are very concerned about this. We need to find out exactly what happened. And I know that the trade minister, Douglas Alexander, who is in China at the moment, has raised this with authorities there.\n\n\u201cClearly, it would not be right to prevent a British MP from entering another country purely on the basis of what they had said as a parliamentarian.\u201d"

If Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin can strike a grand bargain with Trump by using economic incentives in exchange for Ukrainian land, Beijing may look to do the same with Taiwan.\n\nAnd that\u2019s causing anxiety among the US\u2019s closest allies in the Indo-Pacific, said Jenny Schuch-Page, managing principal in energy and sustainability with the Washington-based Asia Group. \u201cEven the prospect for a \u2018grand bargain\u2019 with China will make countries in South-east Asia wary about how they will fare,\u201d she said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, did not comment on whether Beijing was looking for such a deal, but he said China \u201cdeplores\u201d the US\u2019 criticisms of its drills near Taiwan, calling them \u201ca mischaracterisation of the facts and truth and an interference in China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d\n\nWhat Trump is likely to focus on is staying competitive with China, which is ahead in areas including artificial intelligence, robotics, electric vehicles and 6G internet.\n\nThe lack of a long-term China strategy is problematic, according to Danny Russel, a former US diplomat and vice-president of international security and diplomacy with the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington.\n\nHe points to mass firings in the country\u2019s intelligence services, which included laying off dedicated China researchers from the CIA, as a dangerous move in terms of security and the US\u2019s bargaining position in trade talks.\n\nChina will probably try to recruit those laid off for its own intelligence gathering on the US, he said. A Reuters report suggests it already is.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re blinding ourselves at a moment when the national security and economic interests of the United States and our allies call for clarity,\u201d Russel said.\n\nHow China is using salami slicing tactics against Taiwan \u2013 video\n\nThe defunding of Radio Free Asia \u2013 a sister organisation of Voice of America \u2013 is another own-goal, Russel said, cutting off a valuable source of information from China and other countries that are difficult to report from, like North Korea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of unilateral disarmament in the information space at a time when China, Russia, and North Korea are ramping up,\u201d Russel said of the cuts. \u201cWhy are we voluntarily giving up our best tools of competition? There\u2019s a big difference between belt-tightening and self-sabotage.\u201d\n\nThat may become a security concern for countries like Australia, which has a long tradition of sharing intelligence back and forth with the US. China is likely to ramp up its missions in international waters near Australia, Davis and Roggenveen said, so a reliable flow of information on China is crucial.\n\nA Chinese research vessel making a loop around Australia is a case in point. The Tan Suo Yi Hao has been cruising international waters off Australia\u2019s southern and western coasts for two weeks surveying subsea communication cables \u2013 critical infrastructure that allows Australians to send everything from emails to military secrets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer it wasn\u2019t there,\u201d is about as much as Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese could say when asked by journalists for his thoughts.\n\nWithout a strong signal on the region from Trump, there could be more Chinese ships to come."

    "content": "Australians are increasingly avoiding travel to the United States under Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency, fresh data shows, with forecasters expecting tourist numbers to plummet further throughout the year.\n\nOfficial statistics from the US International Trade Administration reveal the number of visitors from Australia in March 2025 was down by 7% compared with March 2024 \u2013 a reduction of 4,559 people.\n\nThis is the largest decline since March 2021, when the Covid-19 pandemic was disrupting international travel.\n\n\n\nThe figures \u2013 which count any visit of one or more nights \u2013 also show sharp drops in visitors from Europe and other areas, as countries updated their travel advice for the United States. Overseas arrivals to the US from all origins dropped 11.6% in March, the government data showed.\n\nThe downturn in travel following Trump\u2019s inauguration exceeded even the global tourism industry\u2019s worst case predictions, according to travel analytics group Tourism Economics.\n\n\n\nAside from the long-term weakness in the Australian dollar meaning more expensive holidayss, a string of incidents with US border protocols since January may have left some reconsidering their destination.\n\nGuardian Australia last week reported the case of an Australian man with a working visa who was detained and deported on returning to the US. The man alleged border officials called him \u201cretarded\u201d and boasted \u201cTrump is back in town\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, an award-winning Australian comedian cancelled a planned trip to the US after receiving legal advice that she could be stopped at the border due to her previous jokes about the Trump administration.\n\nThe incidents have prompted unease among Australian academics, many of whom are now refusing to attend US conferences for fear of being detained.\n\nGender-diverse Australians have also been warned they may face visa delays following Trump\u2019s executive order on gender.\n\nJames Kavanagh, Flight Centre\u2019s CEO of leisure travel, said that while the US has long been a firm favourite for Australian travellers, \u201cwe must acknowledge the political environment in the US and the fact that it may influence Australians\u2019 decisions on where they choose to travel\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor example, looking at the first quarter of 2024 [compared with 2025], while we\u2019ve seen a slight decline in bookings to the USA, we\u2019ve seen a significant uplift in bookings to east Asia and northern Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nMelissa Elf, global COO of Flight Centre\u2019s corporate wing, said that while bookings from Australian business travellers had so far remained \u201cresilient\u201d, the introduction of tariffs could see businesses look away from the US and to places like \u201cAsia and the Middle East\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very different landscape today compared to what it was at the beginning of the year, and we are conscious that major changes that have occurred in the US, and tariffs that are being applied to Australian companies may see corporates prioritise business and trade with other nations,\u201d she said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update: Election 2025 Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "content": "Australia does not have enough construction workers and other tradies to meet election pitches to boost housing supply, experts say, casting doubt over the major parties\u2019 pledges to address housing affordability.\n\nAnthony Albanese and Peter Dutton announced their competing housing plans this week, with both major parties seeking to increase the number of new home builds above the current annual rate of about 170,000.\n\nThe Labor government nominated a target of 250,000 completed homes a year for the next four years, while the Coalition was yet to commit to a target.\n\nBut Labor\u2019s goal cannot be reached given the low number of skilled tradespeople in the construction workforce, according to Tim Reardon, chief economist at the Housing Industry Association.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe can build 200,000 to 220,000 with the labor force we have at the moment, [but] getting to 250,000 is the point at which we need more skilled labour.\u201d\n\nThe association estimated there were close to 280,000 workers in key skilled occupations but a shortage of 80,000 tradespeople remained. Industry bodies have consistently called for greater government support to increase the workforce.\n\nReardon said tradespeople were turning to other careers, school leavers were shunning building and skilled migrants were entering the workforce too slowly.\n\nThe number of construction trades apprentices in training fell 3.7% in the year to September, a report from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research found.\n\nThere were 10,000 fewer new starters annually compared to 2021, while a greater number of trainees were withdrawing from their courses.\n\n\u201cThe building industry still has an acute shortage of labour because we\u2019re losing labour to the mining industry and other construction projects,\u201d Reardon said.\n\nAlmost a tenth (9.5%) of Australia\u2019s workforce have their main job in the construction industry, but the median weekly earnings for construction workers are $1,598 \u2013 about $100 less than the median weekly earnings across all industries, according to the government.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update: Election 2025 Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The unit, which would sit within the prime minister\u2019s department, has been compared to one led by the tech billionaire Elon Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, is taking a razor to US government departments.\n\nWhen asked about her comments, Price accused the media of being obsessed with Trump and repeated her intention to hold an audit of government departments to identify where the 41,000 jobs should be reduced.\n\n\u201cI think that sends a pretty strong and chilling message to anyone working in a department about what\u2019s coming their way,\u201d Gallagher said.\n\nPrevious audits of employment, which examine the hiring practices of more than 100 government agencies, revealed the previous Coalition government spent $20.8bn outsourcing more than a third of public service operations."

Opposition forces are leading a protest against the vote outside the parliament. Share Updated at 11.34 EDT\n\n2h ago 12.31 EDT Closing summary \u2026 and on that note, it\u2019s a wrap for today. The Hungarian parliament has adopted a constitutional amendment that rights campaigners have described as a \u201csignificant escalation\u201d in the government\u2019s efforts to crack down on dissent and chip away at human rights, with some of the key changes targeting LGBTQ community and dual nationals (17:32) .\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned that \u201cIt is clear that they are stalling and not wanting peace at all,\u201d (15:28) when commenting on the latest Russian airstrikes on Ukraine, as she called for more ammunition to be sent to help the country fight against the Russian aggression (15:39).\n\nWhite House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told Fox Business that the US was \u201cmaking enormous progress on tariff talks with the EU,\u201d as the bloc\u2019s trade chief Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d continues his visit in Washington DC (14:23).\n\nThe Bundestag has confirmed that the formal election of the country\u2019s next chancellor is scheduled for 6 May, assuming that the coalition deal gets approved before then (13:48). A youth organisation associated with the Social Democrats indicated their opposition to the agreement, announced last week, prompting questions about whether it can win the key vote among the SPD members (12:09).\n\nEarlier, the presumed next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, suggested last night that his government could finally deliver on Kyiv\u2019s longstanding request to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles, capable of strikes inside Russia (10:48), marking a shift in Germany\u2019s policy after longstanding opposition from current chancellor, Olaf Scholz. We will be back tomorrow with more updates on Europe Live. Share\n\n3h ago 12.21 EDT The amendment passed Monday also allows for Hungarians who hold dual citizenship in a non-European Economic Area country to have their citizenship suspended for up to 10 years if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security. Hungary has taken steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orban\u2019s government. The self-described \u201cilliberal\u201d leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary\u2019s sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors. In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orban compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to \u201celiminate the entire shadow army\u201d of foreign-funded \u201cpoliticians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.\u201d Share\n\n3h ago 12.13 EDT \u00c1d\u00e1m Remport, a lawyer with the HCLU, said that while Hungary has used facial recognition tools since 2015 to assist police in criminal investigations and finding missing persons, the recent law banning Pride allows the technology to be used in a much broader and problematic manner. That includes for monitoring and deterring political protests, AP reported.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the most fundamental problems is its invasiveness, just the sheer scale of the intrusion that happens when you apply mass surveillance to a crowd,\u201d Remport said.\n\n\n\n\u201cMore salient in this case is the effect on the freedom of assembly, specifically the chilling effect that arises when people are scared to go out and show their political or ideological beliefs for fear of being persecuted,\u201d he added.

Much like Vladimir Putin, Orb\u00e1n has sought to portray himself as a champion of traditional family values, ushering in policies that include blocking same-sex couples from adopting children and barring any mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programmes.\n\nBefore Monday\u2019s vote, Momentum issued a call on social media for Hungarians to join it in a blockade of the country\u2019s parliament, in the hope of keeping lawmakers from voting in the legislation. \u201cLet\u2019s collectively prevent them from leading us down the Putin road and depriving us of our freedom,\u201d it said.\n\nOn Monday, opposition politicians and other protesters attempted to block the entrance to a parliament parking garage, with some using zip ties to bind themselves together, and were physically removed by police.\n\nThe constitutional amendment was approved almost a month after lawmakers fast-tracked a law that banned public events held by LGBTQ+ communities. Thousands of people have since taken to the streets, blocking bridges and major thoroughfares with chants of \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cassembly is a fundamental right\u201d in weekly protests.\n\n0:45 Smoke bombs ignited as Hungarian parliament passes law banning Pride events \u2013 video\n\n\u201cThis government isn\u2019t just dismantling democracy brick by brick, it\u2019s now going at it with a bulldozer,\u201d \u00c1kos Hadh\u00e1zy, an independent lawmaker who campaigns alongside Momentum, said at a recent rally, according to Bloomberg. \u201cWe are here because we need to act fast to get ahead and stop it.\u201d\n\nOrb\u00e1n and his government have said their aim is to protect children from what they describe as \u201csexual propaganda\u201d, but analysts have pointed to forthcoming elections to argue that the country\u2019s LGBTQ+ minority is being scapegoated by a government intent on mobilising its conservative base.\n\nOrb\u00e1n, who has long faced criticism for weakening democratic institutions and gradually undermining the rule of law, is facing an unprecedented challenge from a former member of the Fidesz party\u2019s elite, P\u00e9ter Magyar, before next year\u2019s elections.\n\nAs news of the Pride ban broke last month, 22 European embassies in Hungary, including those of the UK, France and Germany, issued a joint statement saying they were deeply concerned that the legislation would result in \u201crestrictions on the right of peaceful assembly and the freedom of expression\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The right to gather peacefully is a fundamental right to be championed across the European Union. We stand with the LGBTQI community \u2013 in Hungary & in all member states.\u201d\n\nThe organisers of Budapest Pride, which regularly attracts tens of thousands of people, said they were determined to go ahead with this year\u2019s march on 28 June. \u201cThis is not child protection, this is fascism,\u201d they said last month.\n\nThe amendment, the 15th to Hungary\u2019s constitution since it was unilaterally authored and approved by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition in 2011, also seeks to reinforce Orb\u00e1n over what he claims are foreign efforts to influence Hungary\u2019s politics.\n\nIn a recent speech laced with conspiracy theories, Orb\u00e1n pledged to \u201celiminate the entire shadow army\u201d of foreign-funded \u201cpoliticians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists\u201d.\n\nRights groups described the amendment as a step in this direction for Orb\u00e1n, a self-described \u201cilliberal\u201d leader, because it allows for the suspension of Hungarian citizenship for up to 10 years for dual nationals deemed to pose a threat to public order or security. The suspensions would only apply to Hungarians who hold citizenship of another country that is not a member of the EU or European Economic Area.\n\nThe Hungarian Helsinki Committee, the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and the H\u00e1tt\u00e9r Society have urged the European Commission to launch a procedure against Hungary\u2019s government, arguing that the recent changes breach EU law.\n\nThe groups highlighted the \u201cgravity and urgency of the consequences of the adopted changes\u201d in a recent statement, noting that they would \u201cforce LGBTQ+ people completely out of the public eye\u201d. The nationwide ban is believed to be the first of its kind in the EU\u2019s recent history.\n\nThe groups also said the amendment went further than violating the rights of LGBTQ+ people and those who supported them, describing it as a tool to further instil fear among those who voice dissent in the country. \u201cThe changes have overarching consequences that affect fundamental rights well beyond the issue of Pride,\u201d they said."

Russia has made similar accusations since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nTrump also implied his predecessor, Joe Biden, was at fault for the war that began with Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion. \u201cThis war would never have started if I were president. That war is a shame,\u201d he said.\n\nHis latest comments prompted an angry response from Ukrainians who are frustrated at Trump\u2019s failure to confront or condemn Putin.\n\nOlena Halushka, of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre in Kyiv, said: \u201cNo one accidentally uses a cluster munition warhead against a crowded city centre on a major holiday.\u201d She also noted that Russia had killed nine children in a similar strike last week on the city of Kryvyi Rih.\n\nGabrielius Landsbergis, a former Lithuanian foreign minister, said: \u201cThis was not a mistake. A mistake is something like imposing tariffs on penguins. What we saw in Sumy is a deliberate continuation of a genocidal invasion. Our real mistake is not helping Ukraine enough.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the CBS show 60 Minutes, recorded before the attack on Sumy, Zelenskyy urged Trump to see the damage from Russia\u2019s invasion for himself. \u201cPlease, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead,\u201d he said.\n\nView image in fullscreen The bombardment of Sumy was the most deadly Russian attack on civilians this year. Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images\n\nThe Ukrainian president pushed back on a suggestion made by the US vice-president, JD Vance, that Ukraine laid on \u201cpropaganda tours\u201d for foreign leaders. \u201cWe will not prepare anything. It will not be theatre. You can go exactly where you want, in any city which [has] been under attacks,\u201d Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe expressed frustration that senior White House figures continued to repeat Kremlin talking points. Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff \u2013 who met Putin on Friday in St Petersburg \u2013 recently said four Ukrainian regions had \u201cvoted\u201d to join Russia, a reference to fake referendums in occupied territory.\n\n\u201cI believe that Russian narratives prevail in the United States. It seems to me that the vice-president is justifying Putin\u2019s actions. This is a change in reality. The Russians are the aggressors, and we are the victims,\u201d Zelenskyy said.\n\nKyiv has accepted a US proposal made a month ago for a 30-day ceasefire. During this period Russia has escalated its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. Zelenskyy said: \u201cPutin can\u2019t be trusted. I told that to President Trump many times. So when you ask why the ceasefire isn\u2019t working \u2013 this is why.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cPutin never wanted an end to the war. Putin never wanted us to be independent.

The Trump administration has indicated that Ukraine\u2019s future security needs are now Europe\u2019s problem.\n\nSpeaking to CBS, Zelenskyy said US military aid to Ukraine had \u201cpractically stopped\u201d, adding that Kyiv was willing to buy US-made Patriot air defence systems."

It accused his government of putting the lives of soldiers and the hostages at risk for his own political gain.\n\nCritics have alleged that Netanyahu\u2019s decision to return to war in Gaza was driven by a need to appease the far-right parties in his coalition, who have threatened to bring down his government if he does not completely crush Hamas.\n\n\u201cThe war mainly serves political and personal interests and not security interests,\u201d said the letter.\n\nThe letter was first published and publicly signed last week by almost 1,000 reservists and retired officers from Israel\u2019s air force, which has been at the forefront of the continued assault on Gaza.\n\nIt prompted a vehement response from Netanyahu, who said it was written by \u201can extreme fringe group that is once again trying to break Israeli society from within\u201d and ordered the dismissal of all the active-duty reservists who had signed it.\n\nSeveral similar statements were successively made in support, including by reservists from Israel\u2019s elite Unit 8200, the biggest military intelligence unit, and hundreds of reservist doctors.\n\nOn Monday, another public letter signed by more than 1,500 former and current armoured corps soldiers and paratroopers with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), including two former IDF chiefs of staff, called for an immediate end to the war in Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe are soldiers who have served our country all our lives.

Photograph: Saeed Qaq/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nIsrael and Hamas have been engaged in negotiations in Cairo, with the involvement of Qatar, Egypt and the US, who have been attempting to broker another ceasefire after the last one collapsed in March and Israel launched a wave of strikes.\n\nReports emerged on Monday that Israel had proposed a deal to Hamas that would see 10 hostages released. According to Tikva Forum, a rightwing group advocating for the hostages, Netanyahu told the father of the hostage Eitan Mor on Sunday that the government was working on a deal that would bring home 10 captives, but gave no further details on the conditions Israel had put forward.\n\nA Hamas official who spoke to the Lebanese newspaper Al Mayadeen said Israel had proposed the return of 10 hostages in return for an initial 45-day ceasefire, when the Israeli government\u2019s blockade on aid going into Gaza would be lifted and the IDF would withdraw from Gaza territory it had seized since March.\n\nAccording to the official, Israel and Hamas would also commit to negotiations for a second stage, which is where the previous ceasefire commitments had stalled and ultimately fallen apart. This would include discussions of a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and the disarmament of Hamas.\n\nSpeaking to AFP on Monday, Taher al-Nunu, a senior Hamas official, accused Israel of obstructing progress towards a ceasefire. He said Hamas was willing \u201cto release all Israeli captives in exchange for a serious prisoner swap deal, an end to the war, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and the entry of humanitarian aid\u201d.\n\nHowever, he made it clear that the disarmament of Hamas was not \u201cup for negotiation\u201d.\n\nOn Sunday night, hundreds of people, including dozens of family members of former and current hostages, staged a protest outside the home of Ron Dermer, the minister Netanyahu has put in charge of the hostage negotiations, leading to five arrests.\n\nIn recent days, hostage families have alleged that Dermer, who is one of Netanyahu\u2019s closest advisers, has been delaying and obstructing negotiations in order to suit the government\u2019s political agenda. The Netanyahu government has pushed back at the allegations, stating that it was doing everything to free the hostages.\n\nDoron Zektser, the father of the hostage Edan Alexander, addressed Dermer in a statement: \u201cCome out, update us on the situation. That\u2019s your responsibility. If you can\u2019t do the job, resign. He doesn\u2019t speak with the families.

It was the only hospital still fully functioning in Gaza City after the destruction of medical facilities in the northern area of the strip.\n\nThe agency said the bombing \u201cled to the destruction of the surgery building and the oxygen generation station for the intensive care units\u201d.\n\nThere were no reports of casualties but the Gaza health ministry said one child died during the rushed evacuation as doctors were unable to provide urgent care.\n\nThe UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, was among those who condemned the strike, calling it \u201cdeplorable\u201d. \u201cIsrael\u2019s attacks on medical facilities have comprehensively degraded access to healthcare in Gaza,\u201d Lammy said.\n\nHospitals, which are protected under international humanitarian law, have repeatedly been hit by Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas on 7 October 2023.

In a statement in response, Hamas denied the allegations, calling them lies by the IDF \u201cto \u201cjustify its savage crimes\u201d.\n\nAccording to witnesses, doctors and patients were given less than 20 minutes\u2019 warning to evacuate the building before the strike. Video footage circulating online appeared to show people fleeing the building as it was engulfed in smoke and flames. The IDF said it had taken steps to \u201cmitigate harm to civilians\u201d and issued \u201cadvance warnings\u201d.\n\nDr Moataz Harara, the head of the hospital\u2019s emergency department, said of the evacuation: \u201cThe scene was heartbreaking and painful. You could see patients walking out on foot or being carried on beds, all of them filled with terror and fear etched on their faces. Women and children were screaming and crying.\u201d\n\nHarara said the hospital had previously been treating between 300 and 500 patients a day, on top of 120 inpatients. But he confirmed Sunday\u2019s attack had left the hospital with a \u201ccomplete inability to operate\u201d and meant it could no longer accept any new patients. The radiology room and laboratories had also been devastated, he added.\n\nHarara said growing numbers in Gaza were facing a \u201chumanitarian disaster and famine\u201d at the same time as medical facilities were coming under attack.\n\nSince the breakdown of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in March, Gaza\u2019s health sector has been further crippled by a blockade on humanitarian aid, including medical supplies, by the Israeli government.\n\nIt has left people facing acute shortages of food, water and medicines, a tactic that rights groups say amounts to a war crime. Israel maintains that enough essential medical supplies have entered Gaza.\n\nAcross the strip, Israel continued to escalate its military offensive and vowed to seize large parts of Gaza to put pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages and accept new ceasefire terms. The Gaza health ministry said that 35 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza on Sunday.\n\nOn Saturday, Israel said it had completed its takeover of a new \u201csecurity zone\u201d that cut off the southern city of Rafah from the rest of Gaza, part of a wider Israeli operation to establish and expand a security buffer zone across southernmost Gaza where Palestinians are banned from entering.\n\nThe defence minister, Israel Katz, announced that Israel\u2019s military had seized the corridor between Rafah and Khan Younis, which he referred to as the \u201cMorag axis\u201d, giving Israel effective control of the area stretching from the Egyptian border to Rafah. Evacuation orders were also given for several neighbourhoods in Khan Younis on Saturday night.\n\nThe prewar population of Rafah was about 275,000, which earlier this year expanded to an estimated 1.4 million as Palestinians were displaced from north and central Gaza by Israeli security operations.\n\nView image in fullscreen According to witnesses, doctors and patients were given less than 20 minutes\u2019 warning to evacuate the building. Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut last week Israel once again issued sweeping evacuation orders for all those staying in Rafah, displacing swathes of Gaza\u2019s population of 2 million people. In the last three weeks alone, dozens of evacuation orders have been issued and 400,000 Palestinians told to move, according to the UN.\n\nOn Friday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said more than two-thirds of Gaza was either under active displacement orders or designated as \u201cno-go\u201d zones, where humanitarian groups cannot operate freely. The areas of Gaza that remain habitable continue to shrink and most people are living packed together in squalid tents or the rubble of their homes.\n\nThe establishment of Israeli control over crucial corridors in the south and northern areas of Gaza, as well as the expanding security buffer zone, means Israel now controls more than 50% of the strip.\n\nKatz vowed to continue to expand operations \u201cvigorously\u201d across the rest of Gaza. \u201cIDF activity will soon expand strongly to additional locations throughout most of Gaza and you will have to evacuate the fighting zones,\u201d he said.\n\nThe statement by Katz urged Palestinians to stand up and remove Hamas and release the remaining hostages, saying: \u201cThis is the only way to stop the war.\u201d There was no immediate Hamas response.\n\nSince the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 on southern Israel, which killed about 1,200 people, Israel\u2019s retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 people, most of them civilians, according to the territory\u2019s health ministry."

We need to do it with the French. There are a lot of other countries sitting back and waiting.\u201d\n\nShe said that if the west did not act soon, there would be no Palestine left to recognise.\n\nChris Doyle, the chair of the Council on Arab-British Understanding (CAABU), also backed the measure, saying it should have been done long ago and that such a step by two permanent members of the UN security council would send a powerful message.\n\nHe also said that if the UK did not take this step soon it may be too late since Israel was clearly intent on pressing ahead with the effective annexation of the West Bank.\n\nThe CAABU has a strong following among Labour MPs, many of whom are furious with Israel\u2019s behaviour in Gaza. There is also anger that two Labour MPs were banned by Israel from visiting the West Bank last week.\n\nThe Foreign Office\u2019s formal position is to say it will recognise Palestine at an appropriate moment of maximum impact, but when David Cameron was foreign secretary he marginally advanced the UK policy by affirming that recognition need not come at the end of a process that leads to a two-state solution. In a reference to Israel, he said no state could have a veto over a UK decision to recognise Palestine.\n\nMacron surprised observers last week when he announced he hoped the June conference would act as a trigger for a group of nations to recognise Palestinian statehood, remarks that put clear diplomatic pressure on the UK to follow the French initiative. He told France 5: \u201cWe must move toward recognition [of the Palestinian state] and so, in the coming months, we will.\u201d\n\nHe added in a reference to some Gulf states including Saudi Arabia: \u201cI also want to participate in a collective dynamic, which must allow all those who defend Palestine to recognise Israel in turn, which many of them do not do.\u201d\n\nThe Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman \u2013 who has personally accused Israel of genocide against the Palestinians \u2013 has said Saudi Arabia will only recognise Israel as part of a pact that includes an irreversible path to a Palestinian state.\n\nAlthough there is scepticism in some British quarters as to how far Macron is prepared to antagonise Israel, personal and political relations between Keir Starmer and Macron are strong. It will be hard for the Foreign Office to resist a strong French push for Palestine\u2019s recognition, especially if it is seen as part of a European-Gulf peace push.\n\nIn May last year France chose not to join Spain, Ireland and Norway in recognising Palestine following an overwhelming vote in favour by the UN general assembly. At present 148 of the 193 member countries of the UN have officially recognised Palestinian statehood. So far no western G20 country, including Canada, Italy or Germany, has taken the step.\n\nThe Knesset voted heavily last month against a two-state solution, but the leader of the Israeli opposition, Yair Lapid, still sees a medium-term pathway to it so long as Hamas is not part of any Palestinian government.\n\nEuropean recognition would infuriate the US and Israel, but the French argue an alliance with Gulf states may prompt the Trump administration to recalibrate its support for Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIsrael\u2019s foreign minister, Gideon Sa\u2019ar, said on social media: \u201cUnilateral recognition of a fictional Palestinian state \u2026 is a reward for terror and a boost to Hamas.\u201d\n\nFaced by the backlash, Macron, writing in Hebrew on the social media site X, claimed he was the victim of a host of unfounded interpretations. He said France\u2019s position was \u201cyes to peace. Yes to Israel\u2019s security. Yes to a Palestinian state without Hamas.\u201d\n\nHe wrote: \u201cThis requires the release of all hostages, a sustainable ceasefire, the immediate resumption of humanitarian assistance, and the promotion of a two-state political solution. There is no other way but a political solution. I stand for the Palestinians\u2019 legal right to a state and peace, just as I stand for the Israelis\u2019 right to live in peace and security, and while both states are recognised by their neighbours.\n\n\u201cThe two-state solution conference in June must be decisive. I am doing everything I can, alongside our partners, to achieve this goal of peace. We need it so much.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of the US\u2019s apparent willingness to tolerate the annexation of the West Bank, the US Senate, voting largely along party lines last week, confirmed Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, as US ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has referred to the West Bank by its Jewish biblical names Judea and Samaria. At his confirmation hearing he claimed Donald Trump did not support the enforced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza."

So far no western G20 country, including Canada, Italy or Germany, has taken the step.\n\nThe Knesset voted heavily last month against a two-state solution, but the leader of the Israeli opposition, Yair Lapid, still sees a medium-term pathway to it so long as Hamas is not part of any Palestinian government.\n\nEuropean recognition would infuriate the US and Israel, but the French argue an alliance with Gulf states may prompt the Trump administration to recalibrate its support for Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIsrael\u2019s foreign minister, Gideon Sa\u2019ar, said on social media: \u201cUnilateral recognition of a fictional Palestinian state \u2026 is a reward for terror and a boost to Hamas.\u201d\n\nFaced by the backlash, Macron, writing in Hebrew on the social media site X, claimed he was the victim of a host of unfounded interpretations. He said France\u2019s position was \u201cyes to peace. Yes to Israel\u2019s security. Yes to a Palestinian state without Hamas.\u201d\n\nHe wrote: \u201cThis requires the release of all hostages, a sustainable ceasefire, the immediate resumption of humanitarian assistance, and the promotion of a two-state political solution. There is no other way but a political solution. I stand for the Palestinians\u2019 legal right to a state and peace, just as I stand for the Israelis\u2019 right to live in peace and security, and while both states are recognised by their neighbours.\n\n\u201cThe two-state solution conference in June must be decisive. I am doing everything I can, alongside our partners, to achieve this goal of peace. We need it so much.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of the US\u2019s apparent willingness to tolerate the annexation of the West Bank, the US Senate, voting largely along party lines last week, confirmed Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, as US ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has referred to the West Bank by its Jewish biblical names Judea and Samaria. At his confirmation hearing he claimed Donald Trump did not support the enforced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza."

    "content": "Iran and the US completed a successful opening round of indirect talks in Oman designed to prevent the weaponisation of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. In a sign the talks over a joint agenda had gone well, they agreed to meet again on 19 April.\n\nA breakdown would have come if Donald Trump had demanded the complete dismantling of Iran\u2019s civil nuclear programme, something that Iran is not prepared to contemplate. Iran insists it is pursuing only a civil nuclear programme, but Donald Trump took the US out of the previous nuclear deal claiming Tehran\u2019s regime was seeking a nuclear weapon.\n\nIt appears he is resolved to pursue an updated version of the deal.\n\nThe Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said the talks had been \u201cconstructive\u201d, and held in a \u201ccalm and respectful environment\u201d with \u201cno sharp words exchanged\u201d.\n\n\u201cBoth sides don\u2019t want to talk for sake of talking and wasting time, and want to reach a deal as quickly as possible. Both sides showed commitment to take these talks forward until we reach a favourable deal,\u201d he added.\n\nOman\u2019s foreign minister acted as the mediator in the talks in Muscat, shuttling between Araghchi and Trump\u2019s diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nWitkoff has admitted he does not have technical expertise about civil nuclear disarmament programmes, but Trump implicitly trusts his judgment.\n\nWitkoff also said the discussions had been held in a positive and constructive atmosphere. It is likely the next set of talks will not be held in Muscat, but Oman will retain the role of shuttling between the two negotiating teams in separate rooms.\n\nIt is understood that the two diplomats did have a brief exchange at the end of the process, but it was described as not a fully fledged negotiation.\n\nAn Iranian condition for the talks was there would be no direct talks with the US while Iran is under US economic sanctions.\n\nBut what was more important to the Iranian side was whether Witkoff would demand Iran stop uranium enrichment altogether and end its civil nuclear programme. There was also concern Trump might table demands that Iran stop backing militant groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas.\n\nWitkoff mapped out an agenda apparently similar to the intent behind the 2015 nuclear deal, but that will also have to address the fact that since 2018 Iran has amassed a large stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, a purity greater than what is required for a civil nuclear programme.\n\nThe next round of talks will have to agree how to dispense with this stockpile and how Iran will allow the reintroduction of an independent inspection regime. The UN nuclear weapon inspectorate, the IAEA, has seen its cameras switched off in Iran\u2019s key nuclear sites on successive occasions, making it next to impossible to know what Iran is producing.\n\nRafael Grossi, the IAEA director general, is due in Iran next week, but it is not clear whether he is yet working in tandem with the small and relatively inexperienced US negotiating team.\n\nOman\u2019s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, said he was proud to have hosted the talks in Muscat and to have mediated. He said the goal was \u201ca process of dialogue and negotiations with the shared aim of concluding a fair and binding agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to thank my two colleagues for this engagement which took place in a friendly atmosphere conducive to bridging viewpoints and ultimately achieving regional and global peace, security and stability. We will continue to work together and put further efforts to assist in arriving at this goal,\u201d he added.\n\nView image in fullscreen A copy of the Iranian daily newspaper Etemaad on Saturday shows a composite picture of Araghchi and the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\nSina Toossi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, said \u201cthe outcome signals progress. A likely framework is likely now on the table, centred on no weaponisation and sanctions relief.\u201d\n\nToosi added: \u201cBoth sides were likely to sound positive today \u2013 even with talks focused on format and agenda \u2013 because they currently need the negotiations to continue.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut without real progress, this dynamic \u2013 sustainable in past talks \u2013 is unlikely to hold as long this time.\u201d\n\nRyan Costello, policy director with the National Iranian American Council, said the parties had cleared a low bar today.\n\nHe said: \u201cNow, it is important for both the US and Iran to insulate the apparent positive environment of negotiations from those who want to sabotage a move toward a deal.\n\n\u201cEach side should exercise restraint. For the US, this could mean dialling back the military threats. President Trump will also have to make sure that Israel does not go behind the administration\u2019s back and undertake provocative steps that could derail negotiations, including sabotage, as we saw in 2021.\n\n\u201cFor Iran, signalling more openness to direct negotiations and ceasing warnings of weaponisation options can help build momentum toward and put a breakthrough in reach.\u201d\n\nWith the Iranian economy in freefall, and Iranians suffering energy blackouts, the country\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has always favoured talks with the US as the way to escape \u201cthe cage of sanctions\u201d, but he has faced resistance from parliamentary hardliners and parts of the group around the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. On 7 February, Khamenei said experience showed it was \u201cnot rational, intelligent or honourable\u201d to hold talks with Trump, a judgment that Pezeshkian said he had no option but to accept.\n\nBut the Iranian foreign ministry \u2013 supportive of talks \u2013 persuaded Khamenei that his regime, already weakened by reverses in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza, might crumble unless he negotiated. Trump also threatened to give Israel the freedom to bomb Iran\u2019s nuclear sites.\n\nTo preserve Iran\u2019s dignity, Khamenei insisted the initial talks at least be indirect, but there will be pressure from the US side to allow direct talks. The two countries broke off formal diplomatic relations after the 1979 Iranian revolution.\n\nPezeshkian, in an effort to talk Trump\u2019s transactional language, said this week: \u201cHis excellency [Khamenei] has no opposition to investment by American investors in Iran. American investors: come and invest.\u201d\n\nTrump, too, has relented both in his rhetoric and possibly his demands, saying on Friday: \u201cI\u2019m not asking for much; they can\u2019t have a nuclear weapon,\u201d adding: \u201cI want them to thrive. I want Iran to be a great, wonderful, happy country.\u201d Trump and Witkoff also badly need a diplomatic breakthrough since their peace efforts in Gaza and Ukraine have so far been abject flops. A further war in the Middle East is fiercely resisted by the Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia.\n\nNetanyahu said this week that a deal would only work if Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities were blown up, \u201cunder American supervision with American execution\u201d. He also called for a \u201cLibya-style agreement\u201d, a reference to Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s voluntary dismantlement of his nuclear programme under international supervision. But Iran senses that Netanyahu is losing influence with Trump over the nuclear file.\n\nIran\u2019s deputy foreign minister for political affairs, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who is involved in parallel talks with European leaders, said: \u201cIf the American side does not raise irrelevant issues and demands and puts aside threats and intimidation, there is a good possibility of reaching an agreement. The Islamic republic of Iran believes in dialogue and interaction based on mutual respect, and any bullying and coercion is unacceptable in our view.\u201d\n\nAraghchi, a veteran of the 2015 talks who holds a PhD in political thought from the University of Kent, is accompanied by a technical team.\n\nIran, which has a reputation for being an exhaustive and exhausting negotiator, knows it is working against a deadline of two months, European officials say, because the UK, Germany and France must signal by the end of July whether they will reimpose punishing UN sanctions against Tehran. The option to reimpose those sanctions, which were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, will expire on 18 October."

Iran insists it is pursuing only a civil nuclear programme, but Donald Trump took the US out of the previous nuclear deal claiming Tehran\u2019s regime was seeking a nuclear weapon.\n\nIt appears he is resolved to pursue an updated version of the deal.\n\nThe Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said the talks had been \u201cconstructive\u201d, and held in a \u201ccalm and respectful environment\u201d with \u201cno sharp words exchanged\u201d.\n\n\u201cBoth sides don\u2019t want to talk for sake of talking and wasting time, and want to reach a deal as quickly as possible. Both sides showed commitment to take these talks forward until we reach a favourable deal,\u201d he added.\n\nOman\u2019s foreign minister acted as the mediator in the talks in Muscat, shuttling between Araghchi and Trump\u2019s diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nWitkoff has admitted he does not have technical expertise about civil nuclear disarmament programmes, but Trump implicitly trusts his judgment.\n\nWitkoff also said the discussions had been held in a positive and constructive atmosphere. It is likely the next set of talks will not be held in Muscat, but Oman will retain the role of shuttling between the two negotiating teams in separate rooms.\n\nIt is understood that the two diplomats did have a brief exchange at the end of the process, but it was described as not a fully fledged negotiation.\n\nAn Iranian condition for the talks was there would be no direct talks with the US while Iran is under US economic sanctions.\n\nBut what was more important to the Iranian side was whether Witkoff would demand Iran stop uranium enrichment altogether and end its civil nuclear programme. There was also concern Trump might table demands that Iran stop backing militant groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas.\n\nWitkoff mapped out an agenda apparently similar to the intent behind the 2015 nuclear deal, but that will also have to address the fact that since 2018 Iran has amassed a large stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, a purity greater than what is required for a civil nuclear programme.\n\nThe next round of talks will have to agree how to dispense with this stockpile and how Iran will allow the reintroduction of an independent inspection regime. The UN nuclear weapon inspectorate, the IAEA, has seen its cameras switched off in Iran\u2019s key nuclear sites on successive occasions, making it next to impossible to know what Iran is producing.\n\nRafael Grossi, the IAEA director general, is due in Iran next week, but it is not clear whether he is yet working in tandem with the small and relatively inexperienced US negotiating team.\n\nOman\u2019s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, said he was proud to have hosted the talks in Muscat and to have mediated. He said the goal was \u201ca process of dialogue and negotiations with the shared aim of concluding a fair and binding agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to thank my two colleagues for this engagement which took place in a friendly atmosphere conducive to bridging viewpoints and ultimately achieving regional and global peace, security and stability. We will continue to work together and put further efforts to assist in arriving at this goal,\u201d he added.\n\nView image in fullscreen A copy of the Iranian daily newspaper Etemaad on Saturday shows a composite picture of Araghchi and the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\nSina Toossi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, said \u201cthe outcome signals progress. A likely framework is likely now on the table, centred on no weaponisation and sanctions relief.\u201d\n\nToosi added: \u201cBoth sides were likely to sound positive today \u2013 even with talks focused on format and agenda \u2013 because they currently need the negotiations to continue.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut without real progress, this dynamic \u2013 sustainable in past talks \u2013 is unlikely to hold as long this time.\u201d\n\nRyan Costello, policy director with the National Iranian American Council, said the parties had cleared a low bar today.\n\nHe said: \u201cNow, it is important for both the US and Iran to insulate the apparent positive environment of negotiations from those who want to sabotage a move toward a deal.\n\n\u201cEach side should exercise restraint. For the US, this could mean dialling back the military threats. President Trump will also have to make sure that Israel does not go behind the administration\u2019s back and undertake provocative steps that could derail negotiations, including sabotage, as we saw in 2021.\n\n\u201cFor Iran, signalling more openness to direct negotiations and ceasing warnings of weaponisation options can help build momentum toward and put a breakthrough in reach.\u201d\n\nWith the Iranian economy in freefall, and Iranians suffering energy blackouts, the country\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has always favoured talks with the US as the way to escape \u201cthe cage of sanctions\u201d, but he has faced resistance from parliamentary hardliners and parts of the group around the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. On 7 February, Khamenei said experience showed it was \u201cnot rational, intelligent or honourable\u201d to hold talks with Trump, a judgment that Pezeshkian said he had no option but to accept.\n\nBut the Iranian foreign ministry \u2013 supportive of talks \u2013 persuaded Khamenei that his regime, already weakened by reverses in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza, might crumble unless he negotiated. Trump also threatened to give Israel the freedom to bomb Iran\u2019s nuclear sites.\n\nTo preserve Iran\u2019s dignity, Khamenei insisted the initial talks at least be indirect, but there will be pressure from the US side to allow direct talks. The two countries broke off formal diplomatic relations after the 1979 Iranian revolution.\n\nPezeshkian, in an effort to talk Trump\u2019s transactional language, said this week: \u201cHis excellency [Khamenei] has no opposition to investment by American investors in Iran. American investors: come and invest.\u201d\n\nTrump, too, has relented both in his rhetoric and possibly his demands, saying on Friday: \u201cI\u2019m not asking for much; they can\u2019t have a nuclear weapon,\u201d adding: \u201cI want them to thrive. I want Iran to be a great, wonderful, happy country.\u201d Trump and Witkoff also badly need a diplomatic breakthrough since their peace efforts in Gaza and Ukraine have so far been abject flops. A further war in the Middle East is fiercely resisted by the Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia.\n\nNetanyahu said this week that a deal would only work if Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities were blown up, \u201cunder American supervision with American execution\u201d. He also called for a \u201cLibya-style agreement\u201d, a reference to Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s voluntary dismantlement of his nuclear programme under international supervision. But Iran senses that Netanyahu is losing influence with Trump over the nuclear file.\n\nIran\u2019s deputy foreign minister for political affairs, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who is involved in parallel talks with European leaders, said: \u201cIf the American side does not raise irrelevant issues and demands and puts aside threats and intimidation, there is a good possibility of reaching an agreement. The Islamic republic of Iran believes in dialogue and interaction based on mutual respect, and any bullying and coercion is unacceptable in our view.\u201d\n\nAraghchi, a veteran of the 2015 talks who holds a PhD in political thought from the University of Kent, is accompanied by a technical team.\n\nIran, which has a reputation for being an exhaustive and exhausting negotiator, knows it is working against a deadline of two months, European officials say, because the UK, Germany and France must signal by the end of July whether they will reimpose punishing UN sanctions against Tehran. The option to reimpose those sanctions, which were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, will expire on 18 October."

But the same court convicted him of backing LeT to provide material support to a plot to commit murder in Denmark.\n\nRana was sentenced to 14 years for his involvement in a conspiracy to attack the offices of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper, which had published cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad.\n\nIn February, Devendra Fadnavis, chief minister of Maharashtra state, which includes the megacity Mumbai, said that \u201cfinally, the long wait is over and justice will be done\u201d."

The attacker used a makeshift sharp weapon fashioned out of metal during the sustained attack, as well as cooking fat. One officer suffered third degree burns.\n\nAfter the incident, the government announced measures to increase safety in the facility, one of which was the banning of some of the most dangerous offenders from the prison cooking area.\n\nMark Fairhurst, national chair of the Prison Officers\u2019 association (POA), said staff were furious, and many had been traumatised by the injuries their colleagues had suffered, with two still in hospital.\n\nHe said inmates had access to meals in keeping with their dietary requirements, and should not have been allowed access to a kitchen where dangerous utensils were stored.\n\nFairhurst said: \u201cYou are giving them the resources to fashion weapons and attack staff. Especially the ideological prisoners, who will not change.\u201d\n\nThe union had repeatedly called for stab vests for its members. One guard is said to have suffered five stab wounds to their torso, damage which the POA said could have been limited by the availability of vests.\n\nThe Guardian understands that also housed in the unit was Anjem Choudary, serving life imprisonment after being convicted in 2024 of directing a terrorist organisation, membership of a proscribed organisation, and encouraging support for a terrorist organisation.\n\nHe is believed to have been in the prison gym at the time of the attack, and in 2016 was convicted of supporting Islamic State.\n\nCounter-terrorism police are leading the investigation into the attacks, with the separation unit used to house extremist prisoners believed to pose a danger of radicalising others.\n\nDetectives have been able to speak to the three prison officers who were attacked, but only briefly to the two male ones who suffered the worst injuries and who as of Monday, were still in hospital. Their lives are not believed to be in danger, and the injured female prison officer has been released.\n\nFairhurst said: \u201cStaff are traumatised and angry. It has affected them as they were such horrific assaults on their colleagues.\u201d\n\nOne line of inquiry is whether the attacks were premeditated. Fairhurst said that until the weekend, Abedi had shown no signs of trouble, and that detectives were searching the jail for where the metal used to make the knife-like weapon came from, alongside any Islamist propaganda.\n\nAfter the attacks, the prison service suspended permission for inmates on separation units to access kitchens and the sharp equipment they contain. The Ministry of Justice, responsible for prisons in England and Wales, would not say where Abedi is located.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This avoids detectives being under time limits to complete vital stages of their investigation, and any risk their suspect poses is mitigated as he is already behind bars and is also isolated.\n\nFamilies of five of the victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bomb \u2013 Megan Hurley, Eilidh Macleod, Chloe Rutherford, Liam Curry, and Kelly Brewster \u2013 wrote to the government describing their \u201cabsolute disbelief\u201d at the attack, demanding Abedi be placed in permanent solitary confinement.\n\nThe BBC reported the letter, which said: \u201cHe should not be allowed any privileges whatsoever while serving a sentence for the deaths of 22 innocent lives and the injuring of many more.\n\n\u201cHe should not have access to anything that he can weaponise, such as hot oil or items he can turn into blades.\u201d\n\nKeir Starmer\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister is appalled by the attack that we saw at the weekend, and his thoughts with the officers involved.

    "content": "A Ministry of Defence clerk is facing jail time for fraud and money laundering after stealing nearly \u00a31m by entering fake expenses claims into the department\u2019s online administrative system.\n\nSouthwark crown court heard on Monday that the former corporal Aaron Stelmach-Purdie, 34, had run the scam for just over a year between November 2014 and January 2016 while he worked in central London as a clerk at the MoD\u2019s administrative headquarters.\n\nStelmach-Purdie, from Oldham in Lancashire, manipulated the department\u2019s online platform for the management of staff expenses and allowance claims. He defrauded the government out of \u00a3911,677, keeping \u00a3557,093 for himself, the court was told.\n\nThe defendant, who was dismissed from the armed forces in January 2016 after he was convicted and sentenced on four counts of sexual activity with a child, used his joint personal administration (JPA) account, a system the UK armed forces used to pay staff salaries and process expenses, to make fraudulent claims.\n\nFive other military clerks who were also employed at the Regent\u2019s Park barracks \u2013 Roger Clerice, 28; Allan O\u2019Neil, 48; Lee Richards, 41; Anthony Sharwood, 38; and Peter Wilson, 55 \u2013 appeared in court alongside Stelmach-Purdie after they were convicted over charges of money laundering and conspiracy to commit fraud.\n\nThe prosecutor, Dominic Connolly, told the court: \u201cThese defendants, who were all employed at the Regent\u2019s Park barracks, made a series of fictitious claims to expenses and allowances that they were not entitled to. As a result of these frauds, there has been a loss of public funds totalling \u00a3911,677.66.\n\n\u201cThese are public funds that had been demarcated for the defence of the realm and the protection of its armed services.\u201d\n\nStelmach-Purdie was responsible for the management of claims for expenses and allowances, and used his JPA account and the accounts of others. He then used the bank accounts of third parties, including his mother and sister, to conceal the proceeds of the fraud, the court heard.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, he approached the other defendants in December 2014 or shortly after, when he claimed he had found a way to \u201cmake some money manipulating JPA\u201d. There were 161 fraudulent claims altogether, the court was told.\n\nClerice, who was Stelmach-Purdie\u2019s line manager, worked as a sergeant in the department and was described as a \u201cspecialist in administration\u201d. He received \u00a37,691 from the fraud and later pleaded guilty to money laundering.\n\nRichards, a former lance sergeant from Amesbury in Wiltshire, was convicted by a jury of 103 fraudulent claims made between March 2015 and January 2016, totalling \u00a3434,825. He retained about \u00a3160,000 of that sum, the court heard.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He pleaded guilty to seven counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and one count of money laundering in August 2023.\n\nAll six defendants are scheduled to be sentenced at Southwark crown court on Tuesday.\n\nAdditional reporting: PA Media"

McIlroy grew up and mastered the game here, a toddler with a club then a boy who flicked balls into a washing machine and set course records, before becoming arguably the greatest player of his generation.\n\nBy 2014 McIlroy had won the Open, the US Open and the US PGA but the Masters eluded him \u2013 until Sunday, when a rollercoaster performance of sublime shots and terrible errors ended with a sudden death playoff and, eventually, a victory that made him the sixth man to complete the career grand slam.\n\n\u201cTorture, my God, it was torture. He nearly forced me to drink. But he held his nerve,\u201d said Eileen Paterson, among a group of former ladies\u2019 captains at Holywood\u2019s golf club. \u201cWe always had great hopes for him.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Eileen Paterson, Brenda Alderdice, Ann Megarry, Dorothy McKillen and Sheelagh Davidson (L-R) are all former ladies\u2019 captains at the Holywood golf club. Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Guardian\n\n\u201cIt was exactly what we expected of Rory: up, down, up, down,\u201d said Sheelagh Davidson, another former captain, who is 92 and still plays.\n\n\u201cIf ever there is water on the 18th hole, Rory will find it,\u201d said Brenda Alderdice.\n\nOne club member sought refuge from the tension of the game by tidying her kitchen. Another took a bath. Others compared the experience to having a stomach churn like McIlroy\u2019s old washing machine.\n\n\u201cPleasure. Pain. Euphoria. Despair. The essential Rory,\u201d said the Belfast Telegraph. \u201cThe great dichotomy of the man. It\u2019s never straightforward. Never.\u201d\n\nA decade ago some in Northern Ireland had not warmed to the wunderkind because he was too successful, too talented, too rich, the newspaper noted, but the ensuing disappointments and fallibility changed that. \u201cWe have felt his pain. Followed his journey back to this point.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen McIlroy transcended the sectarian divide, said Ian Carson. Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Guardian\n\nMcIlroy lives in the US but retains close ties to Northern Ireland. His caddie and best friend is Harry Diamond, another Holywood golf club alumnus. He frequently visits his parents, who still live here, and supports local charities.\n\nSo even the town\u2019s non-golfers celebrated. \u201cEveryone is buzzing about it,\u201d said Mary Cullen, who wondered if her grandsons might switch from football and hockey to golf.\n\nRonnie McKeaveney said he normally cared little for the sport but was mesmerised by the unfolding contest in Augusta. \u201cI nearly fell off my seat. When he won I called up to my wife who was in bed. It\u2019s just great for the county, great for the country.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018Everybody is buzzing about it,\u2019 said Mary Cullen. Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Guardian\n\nIt was also great for Jossie Pops, a Holywood artist who two years ago painted a large portrait of the golfer. \u201cMy phone has just lit up with people asking for copies,\u201d he said. On Monday Pops collected the original \u2013 price: \u00a34,950 \u2013 from a gallery to bring to a private viewing. Hauling it to his car, a voice yelled from a passing truck: \u201cGo on Rory!\u201d\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s first minister, Michelle O\u2019Neill, promised a rapturous homecoming. \u201cI think we have to have the biggest party possible,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are so proud of what he has achieved: he speaks so loudly to all young people out there that if you have a dream, that you can achieve it.\u201d\n\nIan Carson, 50, a Holywood decorator, said the golfer transcended the region\u2019s sectarian divide. \u201cHe covers all the angles. It doesn\u2019t matter what religion you are.\u201d"

    "date": "2025-04-14 18:31:49",
    "content": "More than 10 days after the Trump administration froze roughly $66m of federal funds that had been earmarked for no- and low-cost family planning services, the providers that had been scheduled to receive that money are staring down the possibility of financial collapse.\n\nTitle X, the country\u2019s largest federal family planning program, provides clinics across the country with more than $200m each year for services such as contraception, STI tests and cancer screenings. In 2023, more than 2 million people received healthcare through Title X, which helps people regardless of income, age or citizenship status. For many, Title X is their only source of healthcare.\n\nBut the future of the decades-old program is now in limbo.\n\nOn 31 March, the Trump administration notified 16 Title X providers that their funds would be temporarily withheld \u201cpending a compliance review\u201d, a US Department of Health and Human Services official told the Guardian. Title X programs had just 10 days \u2013 until Thursday 10 April \u2013 to turn over documentation for the review. Yet multiple Title X providers told the Guardian that they have not heard anything from the Trump administration since submitting their documentation.\n\nSeven states currently have no Title X funding, while another 16 states have lost most or some Title X dollars, according to the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, which represents the majority of Title X providers. In total, the funding freeze affects clinics that, in 2023, served about 846,000 people.\n\nAs Title X clinics often operate with razor-thin margins, this delay in funding could prove catastrophic, Title X providers said.\n\n\u201cIf these funds are not released, many clinics are going to be facing the decision to either significantly reduce their staff and services or close their doors altogether,\u201d said Michelle Trupiano, executive director of Missouri Family Health Council Inc, which handles Title X funding for 52 clinics scattered across Missouri.\n\n\u201cOnce a clinic lays off staff or closes their doors, it\u2019s almost impossible to open them again.\u201d\n\nIf Title X funding is not restored by the end of the month, Trupiano said, clinics in Missouri may have to cut their staff, hours and services.\n\nSome providers have just two weeks\u2019 worth of reserve funding, said Clare Coleman, CEO of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association. Among some providers, changes \u2013 such as charging for care that would previously have been free \u2013 may come as early as this week.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment on when Title X providers may expect to learn more about their withheld funding.\n\nMany of the notices sent to the Title X providers with frozen funding accuse the providers of being potentially engaged \u201cin widespread practices across hiring, operations, and patient treatment that \u2018unavoidably employ race in a negative manner\u2019\u201d as well as possibly violating a Trump administration executive order prohibiting \u201ctaxpayer subsidization of open borders\u201d.\n\nMissouri Family Health Council, which handles funding for the 52 Title X clinics scattered across Missouri, was cited for a 2023 job posting that mentioned \u201cdiversity, equity, inclusion and belonging\u201d, Trupiano said.\n\nConverge, which deals with funding for 120 Title X clinics in Mississippi and Tennessee, was cited for a 2020 statement that, in the wake of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor\u2019s deaths, affirmed that Converge\u2019s leaders were \u201ccommitted to having honest, on-going, challenging, and courageous conversations about how our work is addressing systemic racism in reproductive health care\u201d, according to documents viewed by the Guardian.\n\nNine Planned Parenthood affiliates that receive Title X funding were cited for their mission statements as well as public documents that emphasize a \u201ccommitment to Black communities\u201d, Politico reported.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2023, 85% of the 2.8 million people who sought care through Title X were women, and 48% identified as a race other than white.\n\nThe Trump administration should have at least given Title X providers time to amend their funding applications to come into compliance with the administration\u2019s new policies, Coleman said.\n\n\u201cIn no letter does it suggest that there\u2019s something inside the application for funds itself that is problematic,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is just not on the level.\u201d"

    "content": "Republican supporters of Ukraine are using the Kremlin\u2019s deadly missile strikes as their latest evidence to convince Donald Trump that he must increase pressure on Vladimir Putin if he wants to reach a ceasefire deal.\n\nPro-Ukraine lawmakers and aides in the Republican party have carefully navigated Trump\u2019s apparent affinity for Putin and avoided direct intervention in their efforts to shift his support toward Kyiv. But following the Russian strikes during Palm Sunday celebrations in the city of Sumy, advisers and allies have been highly vocal in condemning the attack using language meant to resonate with the US president\u2019s conservative, religious base.\n\n\u201cPutin and peace apparently do not fit in the same sentence,\u201d wrote Lindsey Graham, the Trump-allied senator who has sought to balance his support for Ukraine with his desire to remain on Trump\u2019s good side. \u201cRussia\u2019s barbaric Palm Sunday attack on Christian worshippers in Ukraine seems to be Putin\u2019s answer to efforts to achieve a ceasefire and peace,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhile Ukraine has accepted President Trump\u2019s ceasefire proposal, Putin continues to show he is more interested in bloodshed than in peace,\u201d said Michael McCaul, a representative for Texas. \u201cTargeting innocent civilians as they gather to worship on Palm Sunday is beyond the pale.\u201d\n\nThe strike came less than 48 hours after Steve Witkoff, the Trump envoy, met with Putin in St Petersburg. The Kremlin called the meeting \u201cextremely useful and very effective\u201d, although there was no indication that the two men achieved concrete results.

    "content": "Republican supporters of Ukraine are using the Kremlin\u2019s deadly missile strikes as their latest evidence to convince Donald Trump that he must increase pressure on Vladimir Putin if he wants to reach a ceasefire deal.\n\nPro-Ukraine lawmakers and aides in the Republican party have carefully navigated Trump\u2019s apparent affinity for Putin and avoided direct intervention in their efforts to shift his support toward Kyiv. But following the Russian strikes during Palm Sunday celebrations in the city of Sumy, advisers and allies have been highly vocal in condemning the attack using language meant to resonate with the US president\u2019s conservative, religious base.\n\n\u201cPutin and peace apparently do not fit in the same sentence,\u201d wrote Lindsey Graham, the Trump-allied senator who has sought to balance his support for Ukraine with his desire to remain on Trump\u2019s good side. \u201cRussia\u2019s barbaric Palm Sunday attack on Christian worshippers in Ukraine seems to be Putin\u2019s answer to efforts to achieve a ceasefire and peace,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhile Ukraine has accepted President Trump\u2019s ceasefire proposal, Putin continues to show he is more interested in bloodshed than in peace,\u201d said Michael McCaul, a representative for Texas. \u201cTargeting innocent civilians as they gather to worship on Palm Sunday is beyond the pale.\u201d\n\nThe strike came less than 48 hours after Steve Witkoff, the Trump envoy, met with Putin in St Petersburg. The Kremlin called the meeting \u201cextremely useful and very effective\u201d, although there was no indication that the two men achieved concrete results.

Mr. Trump said the U.S. can cooperate with Bukele to rehabilitate criminals for \"less money.\"\n\n\"If it's a homegrown criminal, I have no problem,\" he said. \"We're studying the laws right now, Pam [Bondi] is studying. If we can do that, that's good.\"\n\nLegal scholars say sending U.S. citizens to prisons abroad brings up serious constitutional concerns. In a 1936 case, Valentine v. United States, the Supreme Court determined a president cannot extradite a U.S. citizen except by an act of Congress.\n\nBukele, a tough-on-crime leader, said it was an \"honor to be here\" and \"we're very eager to help\" with stopping crime and terrorism. Bukele told Mr. Trump what he's doing with the border is \"remarkable,\" praising the plunge in crossings at the U.S. southern border. Under Bukele's tenure, El Salvador has seen a dramatic decrease in its crime rate.\n\nIn announcing his meeting with Bukele, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post, that their nations \"are working closely together to eradicate terrorist organizations, and build a future of Prosperity.\"\n\n\"President Bukele has graciously accepted into his Nation's custody some of the most violent alien enemies of the World and, in particular, the United States,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"These barbarians are now in the sole custody of El Salvador, a proud and sovereign Nation, and their future is up to President B and his Government. They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!\"\n\ncontributed to this report."

Jones said the depth of the quake was about eight miles below the surface of the Earth.\n\nOn Sunday, at 2:54 p.m., there was a 3.3-magnitude earthquake in the same area, 3 miles south of Julian.\n\nThe quake was felt across Southern California and into Mexico. USGS\n\nIt is not yet known if there are reports of injuries or damage.\n\nSan Diego Mayor Todd Gloria wrote on X, \"San Diego experienced a strong earthquake centered near Julian. There's no known visible or major damage to the city so far and I'm in communication with local, state, and federal officials. Please report any damage in your communities through Get It Done. http://sandiego.gov/get-it-done\"\n\nAt least seven aftershocks were immediately reported after the initial quake.\n\n10:10:17 a.m.: 2.9-magnitude, 3 km SSW of Julian\n\n10:10:21 a.m.: 2.8-magnitude, 5 km SE of Julian\n\n10:10:54 a.m.: 2.9-magnitude, 4 km SSE of Julian\n\n10:11:30 a.m.: 2.7-magnitude, 5 km SSE of Julian\n\n10:12:08 a.m.: 2.6-magnitude, 4 km S of Julian\n\n10:13:08 a.m.: 3.0-magnitude, 4 km S of Julian\n\n10:14:03 a.m.: 2.5-magnitude, 4 km S of Julian\n\nEarthquake reactions across Southern California\n\nRobin Boland with the Julian Chamber of Commerce, said she felt like the quake lasted a long time. She said that although Julian is a small town, it rattled a lot of people.\n\n\"Everybody in town seemed to react to it again, everybody running out to the sidewalks on Main Street, Julian. Everybody was outside checking on each other and all the car alarms were going off,\" Boland said.\n\nA resident in Carlsbad said she felt the quake and was frightened by the jolt.\n\n\"We definitely felt a very violent jolt, and it lasted about 10 seconds and our whole entire building was swaying as well \u2026 that was the biggest earthquake I've felt in a long time,\" Caroline from Carlsbad said.\n\nDylan Carniero was inside Mountain Spirits Liquor in Julian when the quake hit. He was getting ready to use the restroom when he started to feel the Earth shaking.\n\n\"I just hear like consecutive three to four different bursts and pops of different bottles,\" he said.\n\nCarniero said several bottles inside his store fell off the shelves and caused damage.\n\nAshely Pinnick from Ramona said the shaking cracked her home's ceiling.\"It felt like my entire roof was going to collapse. We have a large beam that runs through the center of our house, and I started to hear something cracking and that's when I started screaming for everyone to get out, cause I was terrified.\"\n\nLinda Rangel said she was working from her house in Escondido when she felt the heavy shaking. \"My instinct was to just leave the building. I don't know if that was the right thing to do, but I didn't have any shoes on,\" she said. \"I left my phone behind. I just got up and ran out.\" She said there was a lot of creaking, but there wasn't any damage to her home.\n\nThis is a developing story."

    "content": "Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday in a Washington, D.C., courtroom to defend his social media company from federal allegations that the technology giant is a monopoly.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is facing off with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, for Day one of a landmark antitrust trial that could result in the company's breakup.\n\nThe historic trial will be the first big test of President Trump's FTC's ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was initially filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Mr. Trump's first term, before being amended in 2021. In its complaint, the FTC accuses Meta of \"anticompetitive conduct,\" alleging that the company's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp has extended the company's grip on the social media market too far.\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with Meta innovating,\" said Daniel Matheson, lead attorney for the FTC in his opening statements for the agency Monday, \"It's what happened next that is a problem.\"\n\nPurchased in 2012 and 2014, respectively, Instagram and WhatsApp have grown into social media powerhouses.\n\nIn order to restore competition, the company must part ways with Instagram and WhatsApp to restore competition, the government agency says in court filings, arguing that Meta's ownership of the two has extended the company's grip on the social media market too far. The FTC also asks that Meta provide prior notice for any future mergers and acquisitions. The outcome of the case could determine whether Zuckerberg's Meta empire will be forced to break apart.\n\nWith the landmark trial underway, here's what you need to know.\n\nHow long will the trial last and who will testify?\n\nThe trial, which begins Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several weeks.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg will preside over the case which could see a range of witnesses including Meta CEO and founder Zuckerberg; former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; former Meta Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom, and executives from rival social media platforms.\n\nWhat is happening in court today?\n\nThe FTC and Meta made their opening arguments this morning, with witness testimony expected to start this afternoon.\n\nIn his opening statements, lead FTC attorney Matheson said that Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market.\n\nMeta, for its part, said the company \"did nothing wrong,\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Mark Hansen, the attorney for Meta Inc., said in opening statements, that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech giant's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove that Meta is a monopoly.\n\nMonopoly power, said Hansen, would mean cornering the market on prices above the competitive level. But in Meta's case, its services are free. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when it has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said.\n\nAfter opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify.\n\nWhat's at stake?\n\nThe showdown is the largest legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 which could mean substantial drops in revenue. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, makes up half of the company's overall advertising revenue.\n\n\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the AP.\n\n\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.\n\nMeta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.\n\nIn a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"\n\nWhat is Meta saying?\n\nThe social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.\n\n\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"\n\n\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI.\"\n\nThe FTC did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nHow did this start?\n\nThe history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020, during President Trump's first term in office.\n\nIn June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly. However, the federal judge later cleared the path for the case to proceed after the FTC brought forth more evidence in an amended complaint, according to The Washington Post.\n\nToday is the first day of the trial between the government agency and the social media giant.\n\ncontributed to this report."

The NS-31 mission marked the 11th human flight of Jeff Bezos' New Shepard program.\n\n\"I can't even believe what I saw,\" marveled \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King after returning from the roughly 10-minute journey.\n\nShe joined pop superstar Katy Perry, journalist and philanthropist Lauren S\u00e1nchez, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, and civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen on Blue Origin's historic trip to space. Bowe is the first Bahamian and Nguyen the first Vietnamese and Southeast Asian woman in space.\n\nThey joined a small group of 52 prior passengers with the New Shepard program who have made the quick trip to space. This is the first all-women crew to lift off in nearly six decades, following Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova's solo spaceflight, Blue Origin said.\n\nBlue Origin's first all-women crew blasts off\n\nBlue Origin's New Shepard rocket carrying astronauts Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguy\u1ec5n, Kerianne Flynn, Gayle King, Katy Perry, and Lauren S\u00e1nchez, lifts off from Launch Site One north of Van Horn, Texas. Justin Hamel / Getty Images\n\nThe all-women Blue Origin flight crew lifted off on time Monday morning, around 9:30 a.m. ET. You could hear screams of awe inside the capsule as the rocket blasted off and headed toward the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line.\n\n\"I got chills.

They unbuckled and floated in the capsule for about 4 minutes before returning to their seats.\n\n\"I thought I heard Katy Perry singing up there, and listen, she had a lot to sing about,\" CBS News senior national correspondent Mark Strassman commented after the launch.

Perry was the next to exit, pointing at the sky with a smile on her face before kissing the ground. Nguyen then popped out, pumped her fists and cheered with the crowd on the ground. Bowe followed closely behind, also raising her arms. King then walked down the stairs.\n\n\"I just have to have a moment with the ground...to appreciate the ground for just a second,\" said King as she got on her knees and kissed the ground before commenting \"that was amazing.\"\n\nFlynn was the final crew member to exit, chanting, \"I went to space!\"\n\n\"I'm so proud of you,\" Bezos said as he gave Flynn a hug.\n\nGayle King describes space journey\n\nGayle King speaks after her return from space on Monday, April 14, 2025. Blue Origin / CBS Mornings\n\nJumping up and down after the journey to space, King said she wouldn't call it a \"ride\" but a \"bona fide freakin' flight.\" She said that she's proud of herself for overcoming her fear of flying.\n\nKing described the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line as being \"oddly quiet\" and \"peaceful.\"\n\n\"You look down at the planet and you think, 'That's where we came from?' To me, it's such a reminder about how we need to do better - be better,\" said King, adding that she'll \"never, ever, ever forget it.\"\n\nThough they all trained for it, King said microgravity was \"very difficult,\" particularly when you had to get back into your seat and strap in to make the trip back down.\n\n\"I looked like a freakin' moose getting in the chair,\" King joked. \"It was like, 'Just let me get in the chair! Let me get the seatbelt on!'\"\n\nBut Perry quickly soothed her panic by singing \"What A Wonderful World.\"\n\n\"Isn't that nice?\" said King, calling it really special.\n\nBlue Origin's all-women crew talks about launch\n\n\"Profound,\" an emotional S\u00e1nchez said is the one word she would use to describe the spaceflight, describing the contrast of the darkness and the bright moon and then looking back at Earth.\n\n\"You look back at Earth and it's this beautiful jewel. It was quiet. It felt like it was breathing. It was so alive,\" she said during a news conference the crew held about three hours after the launch.\n\nA video showed the six crew members floating inside the capsule, gathering together and saying, \"Take up space!\"\n\nThey each moved to their large windows and took in the breathtaking scene while holding up personal items they brought with them. Perry held up a daisy, a tribute to her 4-year-old daughter Daisy.\n\n\"Flowers, for me, I believe are like God's laughter and God's smile. I brought a daisy because I have so much love for my daughter Daisy, and I have so much love for Mother Earth and I believe you can see the beauty in the Mother Earth in a single, resilient daisy,\" Perry explained.\n\nKing said she was proud of the entire crew for their bravery, admitting the walk to the capsule was \"a little daunting.\"\n\n\"We were all feeling this experience together. I know I will never forget it,\" King said, adding that she walked out of the capsule feeling like she can do anything after conquering her fear of flying.\n\nFlynn said she thinks she blacked out during most of the ride but she felt \"a sense of peace\" at the height of the ride.\n\n\"I almost felt as if I was watching a really intimate film,\" said Flynn, acknowledging that the trip went so fast.\n\n\"What a beautiful world we have,\" Nguyen agreed.\n\nOprah's message to Gayle King before spaceflight\n\nA sea of yellow filled the viewing area at Blue Origin's launch site Monday as Oprah Winfrey joined Gayle King's family and friends in color-coordinated outfits to support the \"CBS Mornings\" host's journey to space.\n\n\"All of us, the whole family is wearing yellow today,\" Winfrey said moments before her best friend blasted off as part of the historic all-women crew. \"I have never been more proud of my friend than today.\"\n\nWinfrey's bright attire matched the sunshine of the West Texas morning and symbolized a light of encouragement for King, who has long struggled with a fear of flying.\n\n\"This is bigger than just going to space,\" said Winfrey, stressing that King has \"real, real, real anxiety flying\" and jumps at even the slightest bit of turbulence. \"This is overcoming a wall of fear, a barrier. I think it's going to be cathartic in so many ways for her.\"\n\nWinfrey, who has been friends with King for nearly five decades, said she was among those who encouraged the \"CBS Mornings\" co-host to accept the spaceflight invitation.\n\n\"I think life is about continuing to grow into the best of yourself and the fullest expression of yourself,\" Winfrey said. \"I know that, I felt deeply that she would regret it, and I didn't want to hear about it for the next 15 years.\"\n\nHer final words to King before the flight were: \"Peace. Be still. Hold to God's unchanging hand. He's got your back.\"\n\nHistory of Blue Origin's New Shepard flights\n\nBlue Origin named its New Shepard program after astronaut Alan Shepard, the first American to fly in space, who piloted Mercury's Freedom 7 capsule in May 1961 on its launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nThe program helps bring citizens to space in a reusable suborbital rocket system. Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, set the stage for future human spaceflights with the program when he lifted off on a capsule, named \"First Step,\" in 2021 with three crewmates.\n\n\"My expectations were high, and they were drastically exceeded. The zero G (gravity) piece may have been one of the biggest surprises because it felt so normal, it felt almost like humans evolved to be in that environment. ... It's a very pleasurable experience,\" Bezos told reporters after the successful 2021 spaceflight.\n\nThe unpiloted New Shepard capsule has space for six passengers who each have a window seat, looking out of some of the largest windows of any operational spacecraft.\n\nBlue Origin says the goal of the New Shepard program is also to advance research.\n\n\"New Shepard payload flights support a wide range of research, education, and technology development,\" the company added.\n\nHow long was Gayle King and the crew in space?\n\nThe journey to space and back, from liftoff to landing, lasted for about 11 minutes. Nearly three minutes into liftoff, the crew capsule separated from the booster and eventually reached the apogee, or the highest point of the flight.\n\nThey floated for about 4 minutes before they made their return to Earth. First, drogue parachutes deployed followed by the main parachutes, bringing the history-making crew back down to the ground. They landed at less than 15 miles per hour, astronaut Mae Jemison, the first woman of color to travel to space, explained to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday.\n\n\"New Shepard astronauts ascend toward space at more than three times the speed of sound. They pass the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, the internationally recognized boundary of space 62 miles above Earth, before unbuckling to float weightless and gaze at our planet. The crew returns gently under parachutes, forever changed,\" Blue Origin describes on its website.\n\nAbout Blue Origin's first all-women crew\n\nCrew of Blue Origin's NS-31 mission, clockwise from left: Lauren S\u00e1nchez, Amanda Nguyen, Katy Perry, Gayle King, Aisha Bowe and Kerrianne Flynn. Blue Origin\n\nGayle King: \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King, who recently celebrated her 70th birthday, explained that participating in a spaceflight represents an unexpected turn in her life and career. \"I can't even believe what I saw,\" she said post-launch.\n\nKaty Perry: Pop superstar Katy Perry performed a tribute to Earth during her journey as part of the historic all-women space crew mission. \"I think the perspective that we're all going to walk away from is like, 'Oh, my gosh, we have to protect our mother,'\" Perry said ahead of the spaceflight.\n\nLauren S\u00e1nchez: Lauren S\u00e1nchez, who is engaged to Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos, helped assemble the all-women crew. She has many titles: Journalist, philanthropist and helicopter pilot, to name a few. She said the groundbreaking idea came to her immediately after Bezos returned from his journey beyond Earth's atmosphere. \"Within 24 hours, he's like, 'Would you ever go up?' I was like, 'What?' I was like, 'Yes, I would go up.'\" \"In that exact moment, I said, 'Could I take all women up?'\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"And he goes, 'That's a great idea.'\"\n\nAisha Bowe: Aisha Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist and two-time tech company founder, made history as the first person of Bahamian heritage to travel to space. She said she had \"been preparing for this moment my entire life.\"\n\nAmanda Nguyen: Civil rights activist and astronaut Amanda Nguyen, who drafted the Sexual Assault Survivor Bill of Rights and played a key role in the act's 2016 passage, made history as the first Vietnamese and Southeast Asian woman in space. Nguyen told \"CBS Mornings\" about her plans to conduct two science experiments during Monday's spaceflight \u2014 one focused on plant pathology in partnership with the Vietnamese National Space Center and the second on women's health, specifically menstruation.\n\nKerianne Flynn: For American film producer Kerianne Flynn, gazing at the stars as a child in Michigan has evolved from wonder to reality, telling \"CBS Mornings\": \"I went through my life, my career and never really thought that going up there to be among those stars was a possibility. And now it's a reality.\"\n\nUnique design of Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft\n\nBlue Origin's spacecraft carries a crew of six and is fully autonomous, not controlled by a pilot on board.\n\nThe crew capsule sits atop a liquid-hydrogen-fueled booster, which launches straight upwards, reaching a velocity of about 2,200 mph and subjecting the passengers to 3G \u2014 three times the normal force of gravity \u2014 before main engine cutoff, about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight.\n\nAt an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule is then released to continue soaring out of the lower atmosphere on its own, while the reusable booster heads back down to Earth to land on a nearby pad.\n\nAbout three-and-a-half minutes after lifoff, the crew capsule reaches a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles \u2014 the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale, an international body that certifies aerospace records, considers the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space.\n\nThe crew experiences weightlessness from the moment the capsule separates from the booster until it arcs over the top of the trajectory and begins its descent. Moments after separating from the booster, passengers are able to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth.\n\nAfter a few extraordinary minutes, though, it's time to strap in for the return home.\n\n\"It's about three minutes before the astronauts will get a warning to get back into their seats. And at that point, they have about 30 seconds. It's not going to be a rush, it's going to be very leisurely. All they have to do is be sitting in the seat and then as the G forces come on, our reentry will naturally push them back in the seat, so they have plenty of time to buckle back in,\" Gary Lai, a former Blue Origin engineer who helped design the New Shepard, said in an earlier interview with CBS News.\n\nPlunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, briefly subjecting the passengers to more than five times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl to slow the descent to about 16 mph. An instant before touchdown, pressurized nitrogen gas thrusters fire to slow the descent to walking pace.\n\nBlue Origin's New Shepard crew capsule descends with its parachute system after a flight on Dec. 11, 2021. Mario Tama / Getty Images\n\nThe New Shepard vehicle has a number of safeguards built in. It is equipped with a \"full envelope escape system\" that would propel the crew capsule away from a malfunctioning booster at any point from the launch pad on up, using an Aerojet Rocketdyne solid-fuel rocket motor embedded in the capsule.\n\n\"It will activate in a fraction of a second, it will light off and propel the capsule away from the booster to safety,\" Lai explained. \"Once it's far away, parachutes will deploy and we will execute a normal landing.\"\n\nThe system is also designed to ensure a survivable landing even if two of the main parachutes fail to open and fully inflate."

They unbuckled and floated in the capsule for about 4 minutes before returning to their seats.\n\n\"I thought I heard Katy Perry singing up there, and listen, she had a lot to sing about,\" CBS News senior national correspondent Mark Strassman commented after the launch. King confirmed Perry sang Louis Armstrong's \"What A Wonderful World.\"\n\nThe booster then made its way back to Earth, landing upright about 2 miles from the launchpad as the capsule successfully landed back on the ground.\n\nCrew members return to Earth\n\nAfter a brief safety check, the hatch was opened and each of the astronauts were allowed to exit the capsule one by one.\n\nS\u00e1nchez was the first to walk through the doors, hugging fianc\u00e9 Bezos. Perry was the next to exit, pointing at the sky with a smile on her face before kissing the ground. Nguyen then popped out, pumped her fists and cheered with the crowd on the ground. Bowe followed closely behind, also raising her arms. King then walked down the stairs.\n\n\"I just have to have a moment with the ground...to appreciate the ground for just a second,\" said King as she got on her knees and kissed the ground before commenting \"that was amazing.\"\n\nFlynn was the final crew member to exit, chanting, \"I went to space!\"\n\n\"I'm so proud of you,\" Bezos said as he gave Flynn a hug.\n\nGayle King describes space journey\n\nGayle King speaks after her return from space on Monday, April 14, 2025. Blue Origin / CBS Mornings\n\nJumping up and down after the journey to space, King said she wouldn't call it a \"ride\" but a \"bona fide freakin' flight.\" She said that she's proud of herself for overcoming her fear of flying.\n\nKing described the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line as being \"oddly quiet\" and \"peaceful.\"\n\n\"You look down at the planet and you think, 'That's where we came from?' To me, it's such a reminder about how we need to do better - be better,\" said King, adding that she'll \"never, ever, ever forget it.\"\n\nThough they all trained for it, King said microgravity was \"very difficult,\" particularly when you had to get back into your seat and strap in to make the trip back down.\n\n\"I looked like a freakin' moose getting in the chair,\" King joked. \"It was like, 'Just let me get in the chair! Let me get the seatbelt on!'\"\n\nBut Perry quickly soothed her panic by singing \"What A Wonderful World.\"\n\n\"Isn't that nice?\" said King, calling it really special.\n\nBlue Origin's all-women crew talks about launch\n\n\"Profound,\" an emotional S\u00e1nchez said is the one word she would use to describe the spaceflight, describing the contrast of the darkness and the bright moon and then looking back at Earth.\n\n\"You look back at Earth and it's this beautiful jewel. It was quiet. It felt like it was breathing. It was so alive,\" she said during a news conference the crew held about three hours after the launch.\n\nA video showed the six crew members floating inside the capsule, gathering together and saying, \"Take up space!\"\n\nThey each moved to their large windows and took in the breathtaking scene while holding up personal items they brought with them. Perry held up a daisy, a tribute to her 4-year-old daughter Daisy.\n\n\"Flowers, for me, I believe are like God's laughter and God's smile. I brought a daisy because I have so much love for my daughter Daisy, and I have so much love for Mother Earth and I believe you can see the beauty in the Mother Earth in a single, resilient daisy,\" Perry explained.\n\nKing said she was proud of the entire crew for their bravery, admitting the walk to the capsule was \"a little daunting.\"\n\n\"We were all feeling this experience together. I know I will never forget it,\" King said, adding that she walked out of the capsule feeling like she can do anything after conquering her fear of flying.\n\nFlynn said she thinks she blacked out during most of the ride but she felt \"a sense of peace\" at the height of the ride.\n\n\"I almost felt as if I was watching a really intimate film,\" said Flynn, acknowledging that the trip went so fast.\n\n\"What a beautiful world we have,\" Nguyen agreed.\n\nOprah's message to Gayle King before spaceflight\n\nA sea of yellow filled the viewing area at Blue Origin's launch site Monday as Oprah Winfrey joined Gayle King's family and friends in color-coordinated outfits to support the \"CBS Mornings\" host's journey to space.\n\n\"All of us, the whole family is wearing yellow today,\" Winfrey said moments before her best friend blasted off as part of the historic all-women crew. \"I have never been more proud of my friend than today.\"\n\nWinfrey's bright attire matched the sunshine of the West Texas morning and symbolized a light of encouragement for King, who has long struggled with a fear of flying.\n\n\"This is bigger than just going to space,\" said Winfrey, stressing that King has \"real, real, real anxiety flying\" and jumps at even the slightest bit of turbulence. \"This is overcoming a wall of fear, a barrier. I think it's going to be cathartic in so many ways for her.\"\n\nWinfrey, who has been friends with King for nearly five decades, said she was among those who encouraged the \"CBS Mornings\" co-host to accept the spaceflight invitation.\n\n\"I think life is about continuing to grow into the best of yourself and the fullest expression of yourself,\" Winfrey said. \"I know that, I felt deeply that she would regret it, and I didn't want to hear about it for the next 15 years.\"\n\nHer final words to King before the flight were: \"Peace. Be still. Hold to God's unchanging hand. He's got your back.\"\n\nHistory of Blue Origin's New Shepard flights\n\nBlue Origin named its New Shepard program after astronaut Alan Shepard, the first American to fly in space, who piloted Mercury's Freedom 7 capsule in May 1961 on its launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nThe program helps bring citizens to space in a reusable suborbital rocket system. Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, set the stage for future human spaceflights with the program when he lifted off on a capsule, named \"First Step,\" in 2021 with three crewmates.\n\n\"My expectations were high, and they were drastically exceeded. The zero G (gravity) piece may have been one of the biggest surprises because it felt so normal, it felt almost like humans evolved to be in that environment. ... It's a very pleasurable experience,\" Bezos told reporters after the successful 2021 spaceflight.\n\nThe unpiloted New Shepard capsule has space for six passengers who each have a window seat, looking out of some of the largest windows of any operational spacecraft.\n\nBlue Origin says the goal of the New Shepard program is also to advance research.\n\n\"New Shepard payload flights support a wide range of research, education, and technology development,\" the company added.\n\nHow long was Gayle King and the crew in space?\n\nThe journey to space and back, from liftoff to landing, lasted for about 11 minutes. Nearly three minutes into liftoff, the crew capsule separated from the booster and eventually reached the apogee, or the highest point of the flight.\n\nThey floated for about 4 minutes before they made their return to Earth. First, drogue parachutes deployed followed by the main parachutes, bringing the history-making crew back down to the ground. They landed at less than 15 miles per hour, astronaut Mae Jemison, the first woman of color to travel to space, explained to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday.\n\n\"New Shepard astronauts ascend toward space at more than three times the speed of sound. They pass the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, the internationally recognized boundary of space 62 miles above Earth, before unbuckling to float weightless and gaze at our planet. The crew returns gently under parachutes, forever changed,\" Blue Origin describes on its website.\n\nAbout Blue Origin's first all-women crew\n\nCrew of Blue Origin's NS-31 mission, clockwise from left: Lauren S\u00e1nchez, Amanda Nguyen, Katy Perry, Gayle King, Aisha Bowe and Kerrianne Flynn. Blue Origin\n\nGayle King: \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King, who recently celebrated her 70th birthday, explained that participating in a spaceflight represents an unexpected turn in her life and career. \"I can't even believe what I saw,\" she said post-launch.\n\nKaty Perry: Pop superstar Katy Perry performed a tribute to Earth during her journey as part of the historic all-women space crew mission. \"I think the perspective that we're all going to walk away from is like, 'Oh, my gosh, we have to protect our mother,'\" Perry said ahead of the spaceflight.\n\nLauren S\u00e1nchez: Lauren S\u00e1nchez, who is engaged to Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos, helped assemble the all-women crew. She has many titles: Journalist, philanthropist and helicopter pilot, to name a few. She said the groundbreaking idea came to her immediately after Bezos returned from his journey beyond Earth's atmosphere. \"Within 24 hours, he's like, 'Would you ever go up?' I was like, 'What?' I was like, 'Yes, I would go up.'\" \"In that exact moment, I said, 'Could I take all women up?'\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"And he goes, 'That's a great idea.'\"\n\nAisha Bowe: Aisha Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist and two-time tech company founder, made history as the first person of Bahamian heritage to travel to space. She said she had \"been preparing for this moment my entire life.\"\n\nAmanda Nguyen: Civil rights activist and astronaut Amanda Nguyen, who drafted the Sexual Assault Survivor Bill of Rights and played a key role in the act's 2016 passage, made history as the first Vietnamese and Southeast Asian woman in space. Nguyen told \"CBS Mornings\" about her plans to conduct two science experiments during Monday's spaceflight \u2014 one focused on plant pathology in partnership with the Vietnamese National Space Center and the second on women's health, specifically menstruation.\n\nKerianne Flynn: For American film producer Kerianne Flynn, gazing at the stars as a child in Michigan has evolved from wonder to reality, telling \"CBS Mornings\": \"I went through my life, my career and never really thought that going up there to be among those stars was a possibility. And now it's a reality.\"\n\nUnique design of Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft\n\nBlue Origin's spacecraft carries a crew of six and is fully autonomous, not controlled by a pilot on board.\n\nThe crew capsule sits atop a liquid-hydrogen-fueled booster, which launches straight upwards, reaching a velocity of about 2,200 mph and subjecting the passengers to 3G \u2014 three times the normal force of gravity \u2014 before main engine cutoff, about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight.\n\nAt an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule is then released to continue soaring out of the lower atmosphere on its own, while the reusable booster heads back down to Earth to land on a nearby pad.\n\nAbout three-and-a-half minutes after lifoff, the crew capsule reaches a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles \u2014 the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale, an international body that certifies aerospace records, considers the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space.\n\nThe crew experiences weightlessness from the moment the capsule separates from the booster until it arcs over the top of the trajectory and begins its descent. Moments after separating from the booster, passengers are able to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth.\n\nAfter a few extraordinary minutes, though, it's time to strap in for the return home.\n\n\"It's about three minutes before the astronauts will get a warning to get back into their seats. And at that point, they have about 30 seconds. It's not going to be a rush, it's going to be very leisurely. All they have to do is be sitting in the seat and then as the G forces come on, our reentry will naturally push them back in the seat, so they have plenty of time to buckle back in,\" Gary Lai, a former Blue Origin engineer who helped design the New Shepard, said in an earlier interview with CBS News.\n\nPlunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, briefly subjecting the passengers to more than five times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl to slow the descent to about 16 mph. An instant before touchdown, pressurized nitrogen gas thrusters fire to slow the descent to walking pace.\n\nBlue Origin's New Shepard crew capsule descends with its parachute system after a flight on Dec. 11, 2021. Mario Tama / Getty Images\n\nThe New Shepard vehicle has a number of safeguards built in. It is equipped with a \"full envelope escape system\" that would propel the crew capsule away from a malfunctioning booster at any point from the launch pad on up, using an Aerojet Rocketdyne solid-fuel rocket motor embedded in the capsule.\n\n\"It will activate in a fraction of a second, it will light off and propel the capsule away from the booster to safety,\" Lai explained. \"Once it's far away, parachutes will deploy and we will execute a normal landing.\"\n\nThe system is also designed to ensure a survivable landing even if two of the main parachutes fail to open and fully inflate."

But he raised the prospect of bringing Ozturk back to Vermont for a bail hearing while he addresses her constitutional challenge to her detention.\n\nOzturk's lawyers also argued that the existing record is sufficient to make a determination on bail, and said that the government has had multiple opportunities to present evidence against allowing her to be released while her case proceeds, but has failed to do so. Her legal team said that there is no reason to believe the government would present new evidence to counter their case, which would demonstrate that Ozturk has met the necessary bail requirements.\n\nDrescher, in response, referred back to the Immigration and Nationality Act, asserting that the law presents limits for a court to release the petitioner on bail.\n\n\"There is a legitimate question as to whether the INA would permit such a release,\" he argued.\n\nMahsa Khanbabai, one of Ozturk's attorneys, told CBS Boston on Sunday that it's \"pretty clear, based on the lack of evidence that the government has submitted, that she's done anything that's violated our immigration laws.\"\n\n\"It's essentially just trying to silence and show everyone from speaking out and creating basically this, you know, Soviet-style era of watch your neighbor and report on what your neighbor is doing to us,\" Khanbabi said.\n\nOzturk's case arose after she was arrested by immigration agents outside of her Somerville, Massachusetts, apartment before attending an iftar dinner.

She is currently detained at a federal immigration facility in Basile, Louisiana.\n\nJessie Rossman, one of Ozturk's lawyers, told U.S. District Judge William Sessions during a hearing that the \"sole basis\" of Ozturk's arrest was an editorial she co-authored in the Tufts' student newspaper that criticized the school for its handling of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate in an effort to \"hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\"\n\nOzturk's attorneys also argued that the government's decision to transport Ozturk across three states \u2014 Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont \u2014 before she was sent to Louisiana was unusual and designed to punish Ozturk for protected speech.\n\nRumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University in Somerville, Massachusetts, in an undated photograph provided by her family. Courtesy of the Ozturk family via Reuters\n\n\"This was done to chill her speech and send a clear, chilling message to everyone watching,\" Rossman said, adding that the government knew the public was paying attention. \"If you engage in speech that the administration disagrees with, you will be punished.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has argued that federal courts do not have jurisdiction over Ozturk's case under federal immigration law, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement has initiated removal proceedings against her. Michael Drescher, a Justice Department lawyer, said Ozturk must seek release through the immigration courts.\n\n\"Congress has been crystal clear on that,\" he said, adding that she can seek review of an adverse decision from a Board of Immigration Appeals from a federal appeals court.\n\nSessions and the government engaged in a debate over the scope of habeas jurisdiction \u2014 which allows courts to review the legality of a person's detention \u2014 and discussed whether the court has the authority to consider Ozturk's detention amid ongoing removal proceedings, as well as whether her petition named the proper immigration officials.\n\nThe judge suggested that if the court found a constitutional violation but was told it lacked the authority to order her release due to an immigration detention order, it could create a troubling legal conflict.\n\n\"Then we're in a constitutional crisis,\" Sessions warned.\n\nSessions noted that the case stands at the intersection of immigration law and a detainee's right to challenge the legality of their confinement.\n\n\"The Constitution rubs up against the [Immigration and Nationalities Act] perhaps in some areas but fundamentally, the court's responsibility is to make an assessment about constitutional liberties and if there is a constitutional violation here, certainly that takes precedence,\" he said.\n\nNoor Zafar, a lawyer for Ozturk, argued she is not contesting the executive branch's authority to exercise its discretion to detain people pending their removal from the U.S., but rather the basis for Ozturk's detention.\n\nZafar said the circumstances surrounding Ozturk's detention are \"extraordinary,\" as immigration authorities made the decision to take her into custody in retaliation for her speech.\n\nThe judge did not decide immediately whether to grant the government's request to dismiss Ozturk's habeas petition, or order her returned to Vermont from Louisiana. But he raised the prospect of bringing Ozturk back to Vermont for a bail hearing while he addresses her constitutional challenge to her detention.\n\nOzturk's lawyers also argued that the existing record is sufficient to make a determination on bail, and said that the government has had multiple opportunities to present evidence against allowing her to be released while her case proceeds, but has failed to do so. Her legal team said that there is no reason to believe the government would present new evidence to counter their case, which would demonstrate that Ozturk has met the necessary bail requirements.\n\nDrescher, in response, referred back to the Immigration and Nationality Act, asserting that the law presents limits for a court to release the petitioner on bail.\n\n\"There is a legitimate question as to whether the INA would permit such a release,\" he argued.\n\nMahsa Khanbabai, one of Ozturk's attorneys, told CBS Boston on Sunday that it's \"pretty clear, based on the lack of evidence that the government has submitted, that she's done anything that's violated our immigration laws.\"\n\n\"It's essentially just trying to silence and show everyone from speaking out and creating basically this, you know, Soviet-style era of watch your neighbor and report on what your neighbor is doing to us,\" Khanbabi said.\n\nOzturk's case arose after she was arrested by immigration agents outside of her Somerville, Massachusetts, apartment before attending an iftar dinner. She was transported to Methuen, Massachusetts, and then to Lebanon, New Hampshire, according to court filings. From there, she was brought to an ICE field office in St. Albans, Vermont, and was held there overnight. The following morning, on March 26, Ozturk was taken to the airport in Burlington, Vermont, and flown to Louisiana, where she was transferred to the immigration detention facility in Basile.\n\nDuring the hearing, Sessions scrutinized the timeline of events from when Ozturk was taken into custody to when she was flown to Louisiana. A federal judge in Massachusetts had issued an order on the night of March 25 \u2014 hours after Ozturk's arrest \u2014 that blocked the government from moving her out of the state.\n\nThe judge said the Massachusetts court \"clearly expressed in a judicial order from an Article III judge\" a desire to maintain jurisdiction over Ozturk's case. That order, Sessions said, \"had no impact upon what ultimately happened to\" Ozturk, as she was transferred to Louisiana anyway.\n\nDrescher, the Justice Department lawyer, said Ozturk was already in Vermont when that order was issued, which \"created complications\" of how to interpret and respond to it.\n\nOzturk's whereabouts emerged as a key question in the challenge to her detention, as the Justice Department has repeatedly sought to have her case transferred to Louisiana because it is where she is detained.\n\nEarlier this month, a Massachusetts judge rejected an earlier effort by the Justice Department to throw out the challenge to Ozturk's detention after she was first taken into custody, but moved the case to Vermont because it is where she was located when her lawyers filed a habeas petition contesting her confinement.\n\nOzturk's attorney on Monday also referenced a Washington Post report filed with the court, which cited internal memos indicating that the State Department found no evidence linking Ozturk to antisemitic activity or support for terrorism. Those underlying memos have not yet been produced in court. CBS News reached out to the State Department for comment.\n\nIn a separate filing last week, Ozturk, 30, detailed how she was detained by ICE. Surveillance footage showed six plainclothes ICE agents who appeared to be wearing masks stopping Ozturk on the street and taking her into custody.\n\n\"I felt very scared and concerned as the men surrounded me and grabbed my phone from me,\" Ozturk said in the statement, writing that the officers told her they were police, and one quickly showed what might have been a gold badge. \"But I didn't think they were the police because I had never seen police approach and take someone away like this,\" she said.\n\nShe added that the officers did not tell her why they were arresting her, and that they repeatedly denied her requests to speak to an attorney."

    "content": "\"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King took a historic trip to the edge of space on Monday alongside an all-women crew, whom she called fearless and inspiring.\n\nJournalist and philanthropist Lauren S\u00e1nchez led the all-female crew, an idea she pitched to her fianc\u00e9, Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos, shortly after he completed his own trip to space. King and S\u00e1nchez were joined by pop star Katy Perry, aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist and astronaut Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.\n\n\"These women are so badass. \u2026They have such amazing life stories, all that they've accomplished,\" King said on \"CBS Mornings\" after her trip to space was first announced.\n\nHere's a look at the women who joined Blue Origin's mission.\n\n\"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King traveled to space alongside Katy Perry, Lauren S\u00e1nchez, Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyen and Kerianne Flynn. CBS Mornings\n\nGayle King\n\nKing, who recently celebrated her 70th birthday, said she was welcoming the new decade by jumping on the rare opportunity to travel to space \u2014 as long as she had the blessing of her family and friends.\n\n\"I wanted to open myself up to new adventures and step out of my comfort zone,\" King explained.\n\n\"I've made no secret of the fact that I'm very nervous but also very excited,\" said King, requesting that people send good wishes and good thoughts moving forward if they see her ahead of the launch. \"I'm nervous enough.\"\n\nKaty Perry\n\nPerry told \"CBS Mornings\" she would sing a tribute to Earth during the journey. She explained that her song choice would reflect the transformative perspective she anticipates experiencing in orbit.\n\n\"I think the perspective that we're all going to walk away from is like, 'Oh, my gosh, we have to protect our mother,'\" Perry said.\n\nPerry wrote on social media in February, \"If you had told me that I would be part of the first ever all-female crew in space, I would have believed you. Nothing was beyond my imagination as a child. Although we didn't grow up with much, I never stopped looking at the world with hopeful WONDER!\"\n\nPerry said she wants to be a role model for her daughter.\n\n\"I work hard to live my life that way still, and I am motivated more than ever to be an example for my daughter that women should take up space (pun intended). That's why this opportunity is so incredible \u2014 so that I can show all of the youngest & most vulnerable among us to reach for the stars, literally and figuratively. I am honored to be among this diverse group of celestial sisters,\" she added.\n\nLauren S\u00e1nchez\n\nS\u00e1nchez said the idea of leading an all-women crew emerged shortly after Bezos' 2021 spaceflight.\n\n\"When Jeff went up and he came back down, I was so excited for him,\" S\u00e1nchez told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"Within 24 hours he's like, 'Would you ever go up?' I was like, 'What?' I was like, 'Yes, I would go up.'\"\n\nShe recalled that in that moment, she proposed an all-women mission.\n\n\"In that exact moment, I said, 'Could I take all women up?'\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"And he goes, 'That's a great idea.\"\n\nAccording to S\u00e1nchez, Bezos immediately supported the concept, noting that he believed there had never been an all-female flight.\n\nAisha Bowe\n\nBowe became the first person of Bahamian heritage to travel to space when she boarded the Blue Origin flight. She said she had been been preparing for this moment her whole life.\n\n\"I mean, I started my career thinking I was allergic to math. ... And here I'm sitting here, and I'm just like, we are going to space,\" Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist and two-time tech company founder, told \"CBS Mornings\" in early April.\n\nShe also gushed about her fellow crew members.\n\n\"This crew represents the best in the future of humanity. It's really space for the benefit of Earth,\" Bowe said.\n\nBowe is excited for the endless possibilities awaiting future generations and is living proof that dreams can become reality.\n\n\"I did it because I saw all of you reach for the sky, and I knew it could, too,\" she said.\n\nAmanda Nguyen\n\nNguyen, who transformed personal trauma into landmark legislation when she drafted the Sexual Assault Survivor Bill of Rights, made history as the first Vietnamese and Southeast Asian woman in space.\n\n\"What a historic crew. Each one of my crewmates represents a community. I'm so proud to be representing mine as the first Vietnamese woman in space,\" she told \"CBS Mornings\" in March.\n\nNguyen discussed her plans to conduct two science experiments during the trip \u2014 one on plant pathology in partnership with the Vietnamese National Space Center and the second on women's health, focused specifically on menstruation.\n\n\"Women were barred from becoming astronauts at NASA early on because of menstruation. They didn't have the data to back that up,\" Nguyen, author of the newly released memoir \"Saving Five,\" explained.\n\nKerianne Flynn\n\nFlynn, who grew up in Michigan, said she spent her childhood gazing at the stars with wonder but never imagined space travel would be in her future.\n\n\"This has been a dream of mine for a very long time,\" Flynn told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"It has felt mostly like a personal journey.\"\n\nFlynn reflected on meeting her fellow crew members on a video call in March on social media, writing that she was \"overwhelmed by profound joy and deep gratitude to be a part of this historic journey.\""
