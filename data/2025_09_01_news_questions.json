This year more states than ever are banning students' devices during school hours.\n\nIn Texas, every public and charter school student will be without their phones during the school day this fall. Brigette Whaley, an associate professor of education at West Texas A&M University, expects to see \"a more equitable environment\" in classrooms with higher student engagement.\n\nLast year, she tracked the success of a cell phone ban in one west Texas high school by surveying teachers throughout the year. They reported more participation by students, and also said they saw student anxiety plummet \u2013 mainly because students weren't afraid of being filmed at any moment and embarrassing themselves.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"They could relax in the classroom and participate,\" she said. \"And not be so anxious about what other students were doing.\"\n\nThe findings in west Texas align with results from many of the states and districts that are heading back to school without phones: Students learn better in a phone-free environment. Getting cell phones out of the classroom is a rare issue with significant bipartisan support, allowing a rapid adoption of policies across red and blue states alike.\n\nSome 31 states and the District of Columbia now restrict students' use of cell phones in schools, according to Education Week.\n\nNot everyone is on board\n\nThe rapid adoption of these policies, Whaley says, can sometimes make for uneven enforcement. While most teachers at the school she studied supported the ban, there was one teacher who refused, which caused problems for other teachers.\n\nAlex Stegner, a social studies and geography teacher in Portland, Ore., said his school saw similar results when it adopted a ban during the 2024-25 school year. Their old policy had each teacher at Lincoln High School collect phones at the start of class in a lock box.\n\nHe says some teachers left the boxes open, others closed them but did not lock them. And he, along with some of his colleagues, locked the phones up: \"I was committed to kind of going all in with it and I liked it.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHe said last school year was the first year in a decade he didn't spend class time chasing cell phones around the room.\n\nNow, as the cell phone restriction goes statewide this school year, Lincoln enters into its second year with some kind of ban, things are changing a bit.\n\nThis year students' phones will be locked away for the entire day, not just class time.\n\nStegner thinks it will be a learning curve not just for teachers and students. His school has already been fielding calls from anxious parents worried about not being able to contact their kids throughout the day.\n\nEven so, he expects parents to relax as the school year goes on: \"I do think that there seems to be this kind of collective understanding that we've got to do something different.\"\n\nThe cost of going phone-free\n\nLike a lot of schools, Lincoln High School will be distributing individual locked bags, called Yondr pouches, to students this year. The same ones that were used in the district Whaley studied in Texas, and for about 2 million students nationwide.\n\nStegner worries about transitioning the responsibility of holding on to phones from teachers to students: \"I heard stories last year about Yondr pouches that were like \u2026 cut open, destroyed.\"\n\nThe pouches cost about $30 each, so for a school like Lincoln with more than 1,500 students, this year's policy comes with a high price tag.\n\nOther states have anticipated the high cost and set aside money for districts to make the transition. In Delaware, Rosalie Morales oversees the state's pilot program for cell phone bans and the $250,000 attached to it. As the program enters its second year, she's surveyed the schools that participated last year.\n\n\"The response from teachers is definitely supportive,\" Morales says. \"You'll see a different response from students.\"\n\nThey're not wild about it\n\nWhen asked if the ban should continue, 83% of the participating Delaware teachers said yes, while only 11% of students agreed. Morales hopes that as time passes, that will change as students see the benefits.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nZo\u00eb George, a student at Bard High School Early College in New York City, is not quite there yet. For now, she sees her state's ban as \"annoying\" especially as she starts her last year of high school.\n\n\"I wish that they would hear us out more,\" she says.\n\nShe's worried about the implications for homework and school work during free periods, and says often students use their phones to get work done. Her school also typically allows students to leave campus for lunch, but with a bell-to-bell cell phone policy, that gets harder.\n\n\"It's not the worst because it's my last year,\" George says. \"But at the same time it's my last year.\"\n\nShe's sad she won't get to take pictures and videos of her friends throughout the day, it feels like she won't have memories like she does from her other years of school.\n\nNext year she hopes to be at college and is looking forward to the freedom."

    "content": "How Trump is decimating federal employee unions one step at a time\n\ntoggle caption Rachel Woolf for NPR\n\nSharda Fornnarino got the news in early August.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs was ending nearly all of its collective bargaining agreements. The agency gave labor unions just days to get out of federal buildings.\n\n\"We went in on the weekend, and we emptied our office space,\" says Fornnarino, an outpatient surgery nurse at the Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center outside Denver, where she's also local director for National Nurses United.\n\nFederal employees have had the right to join unions and collectively bargain over working conditions since the 1960s. Unlike private sector workers, government employees cannot negotiate wages or strike. But through collective bargaining, they do help shape disciplinary procedures, parental leave policies, how overtime is managed and much more.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nGiving workers a say in workplace policies, the thinking goes, leads to less friction in the workplace and more effective government.\n\nBut President Trump has abandoned that idea. Instead, he's argued that federal employee unions pose a danger to the country. In March, he issued an executive order ending collective bargaining rights for more than one million federal workers at about 20 federal agencies. Almost immediately, many agencies halted automatic deductions of union dues from employee paychecks, cutting off a critical source of cash flow to the unions. Just ahead of Labor Day, Trump issued a new executive order, adding about a half dozen agencies to the list.\n\nUnions have filed lawsuits, alleging Trump is retaliating against them for opposing parts of his agenda. Lower courts temporarily halted the March order; the government appealed.\n\nTwo appeals courts then said the Trump administration could move forward while litigation continues, citing the president's unique responsibility for protecting national security. In their rulings, the judges noted that the Trump administration had told agencies not to terminate collective bargaining agreements while litigation was pending.\n\nBut last month, the administration sent agencies updated guidance, telling them they could go ahead with terminating most union contracts \u2014 just not those with the National Treasury Employees Union, due to ongoing litigation. To date, nine agencies have canceled contracts, according to the American Federation of Government Employees.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn late August, a judge on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals called for a vote on whether the case should be reheard en banc, by a panel of 11 judges. That vote could happen this month.\n\n\"I have hope that this will be reversed,\" says Fornnarino, while acknowledging that for now, their union protections are gone.\n\nDisputes over time well spent\n\ntoggle caption Rachel Woolf for NPR\n\nAs an elected union representative, Fornnarino spent time advocating for more training for nurses, particularly those who are floated to different departments, and enhanced safety on the job.\n\n\"We were able to put in some protections at their nursing station, increase VA police presence in both the emergency room and the psych unit,\" she says.\n\nFornnarino says the changes have benefited both nurses and the veterans they serve. But the VA sees it differently. The agency noted that last year, bargaining unit employees like Fornnarino spent 750,000 hours of taxpayer-funded time on union activities.\n\n\"With no collective bargaining obligations, those hours can now be used to serve Veterans instead of union bosses,\" the VA said in a press release announcing the termination of the contract.\n\nFornnarino scoffs at that suggestion. \"Truly, I feel like that's kind of propaganda,\" she says.\n\ntoggle caption Rachel Woolf for NPR\n\nNational security concerns applied unevenly\n\nIn his March and August executive orders, Trump leans on a provision in federal law that gives him authority to end collective bargaining rights at agencies that have national security as a primary function. Past presidents have used that authority sparingly. Trump is applying it to a broad swath of agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Justice Department, the National Weather Service and the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees the embattled Voice of America.\n\nThe president's rationale is that it hurts national security when unions are able to obstruct management. In a \"fact sheet\" issued alongside the March executive order, the White House cited the many legal challenges unions have brought. \"Certain Federal unions have declared war on President Trump's agenda,\" the document said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNotably, the executive order excludes agencies that have supported him, including those representing law enforcement and Customs and Border Protection employees.\n\nThat's especially galling to Agriculture Department employee Cole Gandy, who trains CBP workers stationed at ports of entry on how to inspect agricultural imports for pests.\n\n\"They have to know how to find the bugs, how to collect them, how to submit them for identification to somebody else,\" says Gandy, who's also president of the National Association of Agriculture Employees.\n\nThose CBP employees still have their union rights while Gandy's members at NAAE, including the ones who identify those bugs found at the ports, do not.\n\nIn fact, they all used to be part of the same union, but the inspectors at the ports were spun off after the September 11 attacks, because their role was deemed essential to national security.\n\n\"They're the first line of defense against terrorism in the United States,\" Gandy says.\n\nNAAE and other unions have pointed out these inconsistencies in their lawsuits.

    "content": "Media outlets demand Israel grant access to Gaza, halt attacks on journalists there\n\ntoggle caption Anas Baba/NPR\n\nDUBAI \u2014 More than 250 news outlets around the world have signed an appeal that calls for the protection of Palestinian journalists in Gaza, for foreign press to be granted independent access to the territory and for the evacuation of wounded journalists in Gaza needing medical treatment abroad. NPR is among the media outlets that signed.\n\nThe appeal, organized by Reporters Without Borders and Avaaz, notes that at least 220 journalists have been killed by the Israeli army in Gaza in under two years of war. Media watchdogs and historians note this marks the deadliest period of war for journalists ever recorded, globally. Palestinians count 247 journalists killed.\n\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry called the appeal a \"political manifesto against Israel\" that it said shows how great global media bias is.\n\n\"The reports we see in the global media regarding Gaza do not tell the real story there. They tell the campaign of lies that Hamas spreads,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA study by Brown University in April found that Israeli attacks in Gaza since the war began in October 2023 have killed more journalists there than the U.S. Civil War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, Vietnam War, the wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s and 2000s, and the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan, combined.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists says \"Israel is engaging in the deadliest and most deliberate effort to kill and silence journalists that CPJ has ever documented.\" Israeli attacks have also killed dozens of relatives of prominent journalists reporting in Gaza.\n\nMedia outlets call for press protections\n\nThe Sept. 1, 2025 appeal also calls for action from the international community and from the United Nations Security Council ahead of the upcoming General Assembly to put a stop to Israel's killing of journalists in Gaza.\n\nA similar petition signed in June by the editors-in-chiefs of major news organizations, including NPR, CNN, Reuters, the AP and others, noted that the risks to journalists in Gaza are \"a direct attack on press freedom and the right to information.\" They said Israel's ban on independent access to Gaza is without precedent in modern warfare. The only way to access Gaza throughout the war as a foreign journalist has been to be embedded with Israel's military with military spokespeople as escorts.\n\nIsrael's military has acknowledged some of its attacks on journalists in Gaza, saying the individuals were affiliated with Hamas or other militant groups.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists says the military has not provided credible evidence for its allegations and has called on Israel to \"to stop making unsubstantiated allegations to justify its killing and mistreatment of members of the press.\"\n\nIn one such example, noted by CPJ, Israel's military killed 27-year-old Al-Jazeera correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and his cameraman Rami Al Refee last year in an airstrike on their car that severed al-Ghoul's head from his body. The Israeli military then published a document it says shows al-Ghoul received a Hamas military ranking in 2007, but CPJ notes he would have only been 10 years-old at the time.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nStill, Israeli government spokesman David Mencer insists some of the journalists killed in Gaza are militants.\n\ntoggle caption Anas Baba/NPR\n\n\" Of course journalism is a noble profession, but many journalists who have reported from Gaza, so-called journalists, are simply terrorists with a press vest on,\" Mencer said in a briefing to international press last week.\n\nAugust marks deadliest month on record ever\n\nIsrael's lethal attacks on Palestinian journalists in Gaza have only intensified in recent weeks. Palestinian journalists have named 15 of their colleagues they say were killed in Gaza in August alone.\n\nThe latest major attack was Aug. 25, when an Israeli strike hit Reuters cameraman Hussam al-Masri during a live transmission from the open stairwell of a hospital, killing him on the spot. Israeli forces struck that same stairwell minutes later again, killing medics, first responders and four more journalists working for international media, including the Associated Press and Al Jazeera.\n\nAn initial finding by the military said troops targeted a camera positioned by Hamas, but the military provided no evidence and did not respond to further NPR questions. The military also said six militants were killed in the attack, but did not say if they were the intended target nor answer further questions.\n\nThe editors-in-chief of Reuters and the AP wrote a letter to Israeli leaders saying that although the military says it does not target journalists in Gaza, they have found the military's \"willingness and ability to investigate itself in past incidents to rarely result in clarity and action.\" They said this raises serious questions about whether Israel is deliberately targeting the media to suppress information in Gaza.\n\nTwo weeks before the Aug. 25 attack, on Aug. 11, six journalists were killed in a targeted Israeli airstrike on a press tent outside one of Gaza's main hospitals.\n\nIsrael's military said it was targeting Anas al-Sharif, Gaza's most well-known television reporter, who was killed while wearing a blue \"PRESS\" vest. The 28-year-old was Al Jazeera's correspondent in the north and had a massive online following. Before his death, he had denied Israeli allegations of affiliation with Hamas' military wing, and continued reporting despite the risks to his life. Early in the war, his home was bombed by Israeli forces and his father was killed.\n\nThat Aug. 11 attack took out Al Jazeera's crew in Gaza City just as Israel's military pushed ahead with a lethal offensive to forcibly displace the entire population south and fully occupy the city, where nearly a million people still reside. Israel's government says the offensive is aimed at eradicating Hamas, which still holds Israeli hostages. Influential Israeli ministers, however, are also pressing for Israel to annex parts of Gaza, build Jewish settlements there and displace Palestinians outside the territory, a plan they refer to as \"voluntary migration.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhat Palestinian journalists face in Gaza today\n\nA typical day for a journalist in Gaza could begin by walking on foot to the nearest hospital morgue to count the dead from Israeli airstrikes \u2014 diesel is too expensive and not being allowed into Gaza at scale by Israel.\n\nJournalists in Gaza do this work while also searching for food and drinking water for their families, and while searching for charging stations for their phones and for an internet connection to upload their material to editors for the world to see. They might then rush to the scene of an Israeli airstrike or funeral.\n\nSalem al-Rayes, a journalist in Gaza for Arabic language news sites, was displaced from his home during the war, giving up most of his personal belongings, like other Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nHe told NPR many in Gaza fear the presence of journalists like him in their blue \"PRESS\" vests, afraid that the journalists will be targeted in attacks that kill those near them.\n\nHe says that while he's motivated to keep reporting on the realities of people in Gaza under war, he endures the dangers of reporting mostly in order to earn an income and afford the high cost of food and rent now.\n\n\"Honestly, we reached a level that we don't have another choice,\" al-Rayes said.\n\nDaniel Estrin in Tel Aviv and Ahmed Abu Hamda in Cairo contributed to this report."

All actions that have been taken in regards to the unaccompanied minors have taken the children's human rights into account and have complied with due process, the government alleged.\n\nNPR asked the Guatemalan government how many children it had requested be returned from the U.S., and whether all of their parents have asked that the children be returned to Guatemala, as a U.S. attorney indicated in a hearing on Aug. 31. The Guatemalan government did not immediately respond and did not directly address those questions in its statement.\n\nThe statement appears to contain a factual error. The Guatemalan government said it suggested the idea of sending back the unaccompanied minors to Noem while she was in the country in July. But Noem visited Guatemala on June 26, after making stops in Costa Rica, Honduras and Paraguay in a tour of Central America.\n\nDuring that visit, Noem and Guatemalan Interior Minister Francisco Jimenez signed agreements, including one to potentially allow people not originally from Guatemala to seek asylum in Guatemala instead of the U.S., despite the fact that U.S. law permits asylum seekers to remain as they comply with court proceedings relevant to their case. Noem was also pictured on June 26 watching people being deported from the U.S. while at La Aurora International Airport in Guatemala City, with U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala Tobin Bradley.\n\ntoggle caption Anna Moneymaker/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NPR regarding whether Guatemala had suggested that the unaccompanied minors be returned to Guatemala while Noem was visiting the country in June.\n\nSome attorneys representing the Guatemalan children set to be deported disagree with Guatemala's statement that the process to remove the unaccompanied minors has not disregarded their rights. In the attempt to send children away without allowing them to first finish pursuing their asylum claims, lawyers for the National Immigration Law Center, the law firm representing some of the Guatemalan children in the U.S., believe the U.S. has violated both federal laws and the U.S. constitution.\n\n\"In the dead of night on a holiday weekend, the Trump administration ripped vulnerable, frightened children from their beds and attempted to return them to danger in Guatemala,\" said Efr\u00e9n C. Olivares, the Vice President of Litigation at the National Immigration Law Center.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe U.S. district court issuance of an emergency Temporary Restraining Order on Aug. 31 prevented the government from removing any unaccompanied Guatemalan minors in U.S. custody for the next 14 days. The National Immigration Law Center has vowed to continue defending the Guatemalan children's right to stay in the U.S."

As Texas Public Radio's David Martin Davies reports, the Tivy Antler varsity football team took on Del Rio in their season opener at Kerrville's Antler Stadium, the same location that was a volunteer hub after the July 4th flooding and where a recent massive memorial was held.\n\nSCOTT DETROW, HOST:\n\nThe start of high school football season is always a big deal in Texas. But when the Tivy Antlers in Kerrville played this weekend, it took on extra significance as part of the community's healing from the devastating flash flooding in July. Texas Public Radio's David Martin Davies reports.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I need to purchase tickets.\n\nREBECCA CRIDER: All right. How many you want?\n\nDAVID MARTIN DAVIES, BYLINE: At the Kerrville Independent School District Tivy Antler Stadium, Rebecca Crider has been selling tickets for the last 25 years. But this night's game is different.\n\nCRIDER: I feel honored to be in the presence of all those involved in the rescues, and I'm glad they were here.\n\nDAVIES: This is the first varsity game since the big flood, and it's being played to salute the first responders who showed up when disaster hit, which included a flyover of National Guard Black Hawk helicopters.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTERS FLYING OVERHEAD)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: We are proud to salute our first responder honorary captains for this first varsity football game.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: These people represent the bravery and commitment that keep our hill country community safe.\n\nDAVIES: In the early morning hours of July 4, a stalled cluster of thunderstorms dumped over a foot of rain that funneled into the Guadalupe River. It rose catastrophically - almost 30 feet. Without warning, a wall of water smashed into holiday vacationers and summer camps. At least 135 people were killed. At Camp Mystic, a Christian girls summer camp, 27 lost their lives.\n\nSKYLER DERRINGTON: (Singing) Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.\n\nDAVIES: On Friday night, a survivor of Camp Mystic, 12-year-old Skyler Derrington, sang her own rendition of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah.\"\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: KISD Heroes - their willingness to put other safety above their own.\n\nDAVIES: School bus drivers were also being recognized for their bravery. During the flood, they became first responders and came to the rescue of children trapped by the flood waters. That morning, Kerrville High School principal Rick Sralla organized a convoy of 10 school buses.\n\nRICK SRALLA: Very difficult driving, very difficult terrain, mud, all those kind of things - and we arrived at the camps. The camps were doing a good job of keeping the kids in kind of a triage session. But we arrived, and there were kids in their pajamas with their stuffed animals.\n\nDAVIES: Sralla said he sees his own students dealing with the trauma of that day.\n\nSRALLA: We didn't know their stories when it was happening, but after a while, you know, they surface, and we help those needs. We've got lots of help for all of our children, all of our family, all of our community members.\n\nDAVIES: Sralla said part of that healing is football, which is more than a game. Before kickoff in the locker room, head coach Curtis Neill addressed his players.\n\nCURTIS NEILL: When we get out there, support one another. There's going to be great things that happen. There's going to be some things where we're going to have some setbacks, adversity. It's going to hit us square in the mouth. We got to hold on to one another. We got to support one another. And we just got to regroup and go. It's that simple. Everybody got it?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FOOTBALL PLAYERS: Yes, sir.\n\nUNIDENTIFED ANNOUNCER #3: Touchdown, Tivys.\n\nDAVIES: The Antlers took to the field against the Del Rio Rams.

The incident was not a \"targeted attack,\" Ragusa added, and asked people to \"refrain from spreading unfounded conspiracy theories.\"\n\nGiuliani is \"fully alert and conscious, and his medical team is pleased with his progress,\" Ragusa said in a statement to NPR on Sunday evening.\n\n\"The Mayor is eager to return to his work and looks forward to getting back to business in just a few days,\" he added.\n\nBefore the accident, Giuliani had been \"flagged down\" by a woman who was involved in a domestic violence incident and he \"immediately rendered assistance and contacted 911,\" Ragusa also stated. The former mayor remained on scene until law enforcement arrived to ensure the woman's safety.\n\nNew Hampshire State Police said in a statement released Sunday night they were investigating a domestic violence incident on I-93 in Manchester before 10 p.m. ET when the crash occurred on the other side of the interstate.\n\n\"As a result of the collision, both vehicles went into the median and were heavily damaged.

He continued to be a prominent face in Republican politics, becoming a key piece of President Trump's legal team challenging the 2020 election results, making false claims about widespread voter fraud that have been roundly debunked.\n\nIn the wake of that, Giuliani has faced significant legal troubles of his own. He was indicted in both Georgia and Arizona related to his role in attempts to overturn the 2020 election. In a separate case, Giuliani was ordered by a federal jury to pay two former Georgia election workers $148 million for defamation after he claimed the pair engaged in a fake ballot processing scheme. He was found to be in contempt of court for failing to comply with that judgement in January."

    "content": "Rudy Giuliani hospitalized with broken vertebra after car accident, spokesperson says\n\ntoggle caption Ted Shaffrey/AP\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has been hospitalized with a broken vertebrae after a car accident, his spokesperson said on Sunday.\n\nGiuliani, 81, was traveling on a highway in New Hampshire when his car was \"struck from behind at high speed,\" said Michael Ragusa, who is also his head of security.\n\n\"He was transported to a nearby trauma center, where he was diagnosed with a fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple lacerations and contusions, as well as injuries to his left arm and lower leg,\" Ragusa wrote on social media. \"His business partner and medical provider were promptly contacted and arrived at the hospital to oversee his care.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAlthough Giuliani was injured, he is \"in good spirits and recovering tremendously,\" he said. The incident was not a \"targeted attack,\" Ragusa added, and asked people to \"refrain from spreading unfounded conspiracy theories.\"\n\nGiuliani is \"fully alert and conscious, and his medical team is pleased with his progress,\" Ragusa said in a statement to NPR on Sunday evening.\n\n\"The Mayor is eager to return to his work and looks forward to getting back to business in just a few days,\" he added.\n\nBefore the accident, Giuliani had been \"flagged down\" by a woman who was involved in a domestic violence incident and he \"immediately rendered assistance and contacted 911,\" Ragusa also stated. The former mayor remained on scene until law enforcement arrived to ensure the woman's safety.\n\nNew Hampshire State Police said in a statement released Sunday night they were investigating a domestic violence incident on I-93 in Manchester before 10 p.m. ET when the crash occurred on the other side of the interstate.\n\n\"As a result of the collision, both vehicles went into the median and were heavily damaged. Troopers and fire personnel, who were at the scene of the first incident, witnessed the collision and quickly crossed the interstate to render aid,\" the police said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThree people, including Giuliani and the driver of the car he was traveling in, suffered \"non-life-threatening injuries and were taken by ambulance to area hospitals for treatment,\" the police also said.\n\nAndrew Giuliani, his son, thanked those who reached out and called his father tough in a social media post on Sunday.\n\nThe former mayor of New York became \"America's mayor\" in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center towers in the country's largest city. He continued to be a prominent face in Republican politics, becoming a key piece of President Trump's legal team challenging the 2020 election results, making false claims about widespread voter fraud that have been roundly debunked.\n\nIn the wake of that, Giuliani has faced significant legal troubles of his own.

As ticket sales climbed this week, game officials raised the estimated Saturday night jackpot to $1 billion from $950 million, before taxes. Payments would be spread over 30 years, or a winner can choose an immediate lump sum of $453 million, again before taxes.\n\nThe odds of matching all six numbers are astronomical: 1 in 292.2 million. The odds of getting struck by lightning are far greater. But with so many people putting down money for a chance at life-changing wealth, someone eventually wins.\n\nPowerball, which costs $2 per ticket, is played in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Drawings are held each week on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday nights."

Their party is struggling to address it\n\nWASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014\n\nDemocrat Eric McWilliams doesn't approve of Donald Trump sending National Guard troops to cities like Washington, D.C. And he's certainly not supportive of most of the president's policies.\n\nBut the 63-year old retired handyman and U.S. Navy veteran does praise Trump for one thing. \u201cWhen it comes to crime,\" he said, \u201cHe\u2019s alright. He's doing pretty good. How he\u2019s doing it is another matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrime is a big problem,\u201d he went on. \u201cAt least he is doing something.\u201d\n\nMcWilliams' views reflect the thinking of a lot of Democrats, according to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. It finds that while most disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue, a large majority, 68%, see crime as a \u201cmajor problem\u201d in large cities. That's despite the fact that statistics show crime, overall, is down across the nation, with some cities reporting 30-year lows.\n\nThe findings underscore the challenge facing Democratic leaders. They must thread the needle between criticizing Trump's policies, which are deeply unpopular among their base, while at the same time not dismissing widespread concerns about safety, which are amplified in many news sources and in online forums like Facebook and the popular Nextdoor app.\n\nThat could create a vulnerability for the party heading into next year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nWhile Trump remains unpopular overall, the new poll finds his approach to crime has earned him high marks compared to other issues like the economy and immigration. About half of U.S. adults, 53%, say they approve of his handling of crime.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans, 81%, also see crime as a \u201cmajor problem\u201d in large cities. That includes nearly all Republicans, roughly three-quarters of independents and nearly 7 in 10 Democrats.\n\nThe issue is complex, though, even for those who are concerned. In interviews, participants who oppose Trump\u2019s unprecedented takeover of Washington, D.C.\u2019s police department and threats to expand his efforts to other cities expressed alarm, calling his actions anti-American and part of what they see as an effort to distract the public from issues the White House would prefer they ignore.\n\nThey believe resources would be better spent investing in community policing, mental health services and passing meaningful laws to get guns off city streets.\n\nBut many also bemoaned the state of public safety in the country, even if they said they felt safe in their own neighborhoods and acknowledged that violent crime is down after a pandemic-era spike. Several noted that they or their neighbors had been the victims of serious crimes and complained about what they felt was a lackluster police response.\n\nBrian Cornelia, 62, a retired foreman and lifelong Democrat who lives in Michigan, near Marquette, is displeased with the performance of both parties.\n\n\u201cDefund the police was nuts,\" he said. \u201cNow with Trump what he\u2019s doing, that\u2019s nuts too.\"\n\nHe said that crime is \u201cnot at all\u201d an issue where he lives and \u201cdown all over,\" but nonetheless appreciates that Trump is doing something.\n\n\"Something is happening. We\u2019ll see if it helps or not, but it's better than not doing anything,\" he said. Either way, he said Trump had backed Democrats into a corner.\n\n\u201cIt's bad. How are you going to say you don't want crime to be dealt with?\" he said. \u201cIf you argue with him, what, you\u2019re soft on crime? It\u2019s a Catch-22.\"\n\nEven those who give Trump credit question his tactics.\n\nAbout 8 in 10 Democrats say it\u2019s \u201ccompletely\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d unacceptable for the president to seize control of local police departments, as he\u2019s done in Washington. And about 6 in 10 say it\u2019s unacceptable for the federal government to use the U.S. military and National Guard to assist local police.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t approve of national troops having authority over fellow Americans,\u201d said McWilliams, the Navy veteran. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t use our armed forces to patrol our own people. That turns it into an authoritarian state.\u201d\n\nMcWilliams, who lives in White Hall, Pennsylvania, said crime \u201cis practically non-existent\u201d in his neighborhood, where he doesn't even lock his door. But he worries about the situation in nearby Allentown and across the nation, noting the deadly mass shooting this week at a Minneapolis church.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad he does want to fight crime because \u2013 well, nobody else is doing it, certainly not our mayors and governors and police department,\u201d he said, accusing them of being \u201ctoo politically correct\u201d to pursue controversial tactics like \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d which he believes works.\n\nOthers are far more skeptical.\n\n\u201cI think he's just terrible,\" said Carolyn Perry, 79, a lifelong Democrat and retired nurse who lives in Philadelphia and sees Trump\u2019s actions as an excuse to target Democratic cities that voted against him.\n\n\u201cI think this National Guard thing he\u2019s doing is ridiculous,\" she said. \u201cIt's almost like martial law. And now they\u2019re walking around with guns.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Star Kaye, 59, who lives in Downey, California, near Los Angeles, agreed, slamming Trump for using the military against residents \u2014 something she said the Revolutionary War was fought, in part, against.\n\n\u201cOf course living in a big city, I understand concerns about crime,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think an authoritarian playbook is the right way to fix them.\u201d\u2032\n\nIf the president really wanted to tackle the issue, she argued, he would be investing in local police departments instead of diverting resources to immigration enforcement. She sees the crackdown as part of a broader effort to bolster Republicans' chances in next year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s going to want to have troops in the street to intimidate people not to vote,\u201d she said.\n\nPart of the challenge for Democrats is that, historically, crime has not been a top issue for their base.\n\nGallup polling from April found that only about one-third of Democrats said they worried \u201ca great deal\u201d about crime and violence and were more likely to be concerned about the economy, Social Security, the environment, hunger and homelessness.\n\nCrime has also traditionally been a stronger issue for Republicans, including in the 2024 election.\n\nDemocrats acknowledged the gap last week at a national party gathering in Minneapolis. In a presentation to Democratic National Committee members, party strategists noted Republicans spent about three times as much on crime-related ads as Democrats in recent presidential election years.\n\nThey urged Democrats not to mimic the \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d rhetoric Republicans have embraced for decades, but instead position themselves as being \u201cserious about safety, not empty scare tactics.\u201d\n\n\u201cDON\u2019T TAKE TRUMP\u2019S CRIME BAIT\u2014INSTEAD, LEAN INTO SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT CRIME, RESPOND TO CRISIS, AND STOP VIOLENCE,\" they urged in a slide presentation.\n\nSome Democratic politicians have been trying to do just that.\n\nThey include Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who has been pushing back against Trump's threats to expand his efforts to Chicago. He defended Democrats' approach and said local efforts to tackle crime have been working.\n\n\u201cWe also are tough on crime,\u201d Pritzker told The Associated Press in an interview on Wednesday. Trump, he said, \u201ctalks a good game.\"\n\n\u201cWhat the President has done, however, is to make it harder to crack down on crime,\" he said.\n\n___ Colvin reported from New York. Associated Press writers Sophia Tareen in Chicago and Steve Peoples in Minneapolis contributed reporting.\n\n___\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,182 adults was conducted Aug. 21-25, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

It\u2019s a Catch-22.\"\n\nEven those who give Trump credit question his tactics.\n\nAbout 8 in 10 Democrats say it\u2019s \u201ccompletely\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d unacceptable for the president to seize control of local police departments, as he\u2019s done in Washington. And about 6 in 10 say it\u2019s unacceptable for the federal government to use the U.S. military and National Guard to assist local police.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t approve of national troops having authority over fellow Americans,\u201d said McWilliams, the Navy veteran. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t use our armed forces to patrol our own people. That turns it into an authoritarian state.\u201d\n\nMcWilliams, who lives in White Hall, Pennsylvania, said crime \u201cis practically non-existent\u201d in his neighborhood, where he doesn't even lock his door. But he worries about the situation in nearby Allentown and across the nation, noting the deadly mass shooting this week at a Minneapolis church.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad he does want to fight crime because \u2013 well, nobody else is doing it, certainly not our mayors and governors and police department,\u201d he said, accusing them of being \u201ctoo politically correct\u201d to pursue controversial tactics like \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d which he believes works.\n\nOthers are far more skeptical.\n\n\u201cI think he's just terrible,\" said Carolyn Perry, 79, a lifelong Democrat and retired nurse who lives in Philadelphia and sees Trump\u2019s actions as an excuse to target Democratic cities that voted against him.\n\n\u201cI think this National Guard thing he\u2019s doing is ridiculous,\" she said. \u201cIt's almost like martial law. And now they\u2019re walking around with guns.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Star Kaye, 59, who lives in Downey, California, near Los Angeles, agreed, slamming Trump for using the military against residents \u2014 something she said the Revolutionary War was fought, in part, against.\n\n\u201cOf course living in a big city, I understand concerns about crime,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think an authoritarian playbook is the right way to fix them.\u201d\u2032\n\nIf the president really wanted to tackle the issue, she argued, he would be investing in local police departments instead of diverting resources to immigration enforcement. She sees the crackdown as part of a broader effort to bolster Republicans' chances in next year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s going to want to have troops in the street to intimidate people not to vote,\u201d she said.\n\nPart of the challenge for Democrats is that, historically, crime has not been a top issue for their base.\n\nGallup polling from April found that only about one-third of Democrats said they worried \u201ca great deal\u201d about crime and violence and were more likely to be concerned about the economy, Social Security, the environment, hunger and homelessness.\n\nCrime has also traditionally been a stronger issue for Republicans, including in the 2024 election.\n\nDemocrats acknowledged the gap last week at a national party gathering in Minneapolis. In a presentation to Democratic National Committee members, party strategists noted Republicans spent about three times as much on crime-related ads as Democrats in recent presidential election years.\n\nThey urged Democrats not to mimic the \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d rhetoric Republicans have embraced for decades, but instead position themselves as being \u201cserious about safety, not empty scare tactics.\u201d\n\n\u201cDON\u2019T TAKE TRUMP\u2019S CRIME BAIT\u2014INSTEAD, LEAN INTO SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT CRIME, RESPOND TO CRISIS, AND STOP VIOLENCE,\" they urged in a slide presentation.\n\nSome Democratic politicians have been trying to do just that.\n\nThey include Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who has been pushing back against Trump's threats to expand his efforts to Chicago. He defended Democrats' approach and said local efforts to tackle crime have been working.\n\n\u201cWe also are tough on crime,\u201d Pritzker told The Associated Press in an interview on Wednesday. Trump, he said, \u201ctalks a good game.\"\n\n\u201cWhat the President has done, however, is to make it harder to crack down on crime,\" he said.\n\n___ Colvin reported from New York.

Experts and state housing agencies say that would set back tens of thousands of future affordable housing developments nationwide, particularly hurting Appalachian towns and rural counties where government aid is sparse and investors are few.\n\nThe program has helped build or repair more than 1.3 million affordable homes in the last three decades, of which at least 540,000 were in congressional districts that are rural or significantly rural, according to an Associated Press analysis of federal data.\n\n\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t realize how far-reaching these programs are,\u201d said Colley, who voted for Trump in 2024.

Additional funding has gone toward projects that have yet to be finished and rental assistance.\n\nTo account for the gap left by the proposed cuts, House Republicans want to draw on nearly $5 billion from a related pandemic-era fund that gave states until 2030 to spend on projects supporting people who are unhoused or facing homelessness.\n\nThat $5 billion, however, may be far less, since many projects haven\u2019t yet been logged into the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's tracking system, according to state housing agencies and associations representing them.\n\nA spokesperson for HUD, which administers the program, said HOME isn't as effective as other programs where the money would be better spent.\n\nIn opposition to Trump, Senate Republicans have still included funding for HOME in their draft budget.

(AP Photo/Rahmat Gul)\n\nCongressional Republicans scored a massive victory this summer when they passed President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d of tax and spending cuts without a single Democratic vote. But as they return to Washington this fall after a monthlong August recess, they will have to find a way to work with Democrats \u2014 or around them \u2014 as a government shutdown looms.\n\nThe annual spending battle will dominate the September agenda, along with a possible effort by Senate Republicans to change their chamber's rules to thwart Democratic stalling tactics on nominations. The Senate is also debating whether to move forward on legislation that would slap steep tariffs on some of Russia\u2019s trading partners as the U.S. pressures Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine.\n\nIn the House, Republicans will continue their investigations of former President Joe Biden while Speaker Mike Johnson navigates a split in his conference over whether the Trump administration should release more files in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.\n\nA look at what Congress will be doing as lawmakers return from the August break:\n\nThe most urgent task for Congress is to avoid a government shutdown on Sept. 30, when federal funding runs out. And it\u2019s so far unclear if Republicans and Democrats will be able to agree on how to do that.\n\nCongress will have to pass a short-term spending measure to keep the government funded for a few weeks or months while they try to finish the full-year package. But Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass an extension, and Democrats will want significant concessions. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.\n\nThe Trump administration's efforts to claw back previously approved spending could also complicate the negotiations. Republicans passed legislation this summer that rescinded about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds and Trump notified Congress again on Friday that he will block $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid.\n\nDemocrats have warned that such efforts could tank the broader negotiations. \u201cTrump is rooting for a shutdown,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on social media Friday.\n\nSenators are expected to return to Washington right where they left off in early August \u2014 fighting over Trump\u2019s nominees.\n\nExasperated Republicans fled Washington for the month after making little headway with Senate Democrats over their nominations blockade, which has forced delays in confirmations and angered Trump as many of his administration\u2019s positions remain unfilled. Republican leaders called it quits after a rare Saturday session that ended with a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations and Trump posting on social media that Chuck Schumer could \u201cGO TO HELL!\u201d\n\nRepublicans now say they\u2019re ready to try and change Senate rules to get around the Democratic delays, and they are expected to spend the next several weeks discussing how that might work.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies, has pushed the president for months to support his sweeping bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose steep tariffs on countries that are fueling Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine by buying its oil, gas, uranium, and other exports. The legislation has the backing of 85 senators, but Trump has yet to endorse it, and Republican leaders have so far said they won\u2019t move without him.\n\nGraham has stepped up his calls after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy last month in hopes of a peace deal. Since then, Russia has continued to step up attacks on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have this thing moving in the right direction by the time we get back, then I think that plan B needs to kick in,\u201d Graham said of his bill in an interview with The Associated Press last month.\n\nHealth and Human Service Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will appear before the Senate Finance Committee to discuss his health care agenda on Thursday, less than a week after he ousted Susan Monarez as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several other top officials also resigned in protest.\n\nKennedy has tried to advance anti-vaccine policies that are contradicted by decades of scientific research. Monarez\u2019s lawyers said she refused \u201cto rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.\u201d\n\nLouisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Republican chairman of the HELP panel that oversees the CDC and a member of the Finance Committee, has called on the CDC to delay a meeting of outside experts who make recommendations on the use of vaccines until Congress can look into the issue.\n\nThe House left Washington in July amid disagreements among Republicans about whether they should force President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to release more information on the sex trafficking investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein. The pressure for more disclosure could only get more intense when lawmakers return.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky are pushing the House to take up their bill to force the Department of Justice to publicly release its investigation. They are planning a news conference this week joined by Epstein victims. The House Oversight Committee is also investigating the issue.\n\nDemocrats are eager to keep pressing on the Epstein files, especially after the Trump administration reneged on pledges for transparency. The case for years has been the subject of online conspiracy theories and speculation about who may have been involved or aware of the wealthy financier\u2019s abuse.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee will return from August recess with a slate of interviews lined up as part of its investigation into former President Joe Biden\u2019s mental state while in office. The committee has already conducted interviews and depositions with nearly a dozen former top Biden aides and members of the president\u2019s inner circle.\n\nThe Republican-led committee will hear from former top Biden staffers in September like Jeff Zients, Biden\u2019s final White House chief of staff, Karine Jean-Pierre, the former White House press secretary, and Andrew Bates, a top press aide.\n\nOversight Chair James Comer, R-Ky., has said public hearings and a full report can be expected sometime in the fall.\n\nCongress has discussed proposals for years to keep lawmakers from engaging in trading individual stocks, nodding to the idea that there\u2019s a potential conflict of interest when they are often privy to information and decisions that can dramatically move markets.\n\nThat push is now gaining momentum. A Senate committee has approved legislation from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri that would also extend the prohibition on stock trading to future presidents and vice presidents \u2014 while notably exempting Trump. In the House, several members are putting forward proposals and even threatening to maneuver around GOP leadership to force a vote.\n\nStill, there is plenty of resistance to the idea, including from many wealthy lawmakers who reap dividends from their portfolios.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Matt Brown and Joey Cappelletti contributed to this report."

(AP Photo/Rahmat Gul)\n\nCongressional Republicans scored a massive victory this summer when they passed President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d of tax and spending cuts without a single Democratic vote. But as they return to Washington this fall after a monthlong August recess, they will have to find a way to work with Democrats \u2014 or around them \u2014 as a government shutdown looms.\n\nThe annual spending battle will dominate the September agenda, along with a possible effort by Senate Republicans to change their chamber's rules to thwart Democratic stalling tactics on nominations. The Senate is also debating whether to move forward on legislation that would slap steep tariffs on some of Russia\u2019s trading partners as the U.S. pressures Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine.\n\nIn the House, Republicans will continue their investigations of former President Joe Biden while Speaker Mike Johnson navigates a split in his conference over whether the Trump administration should release more files in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.\n\nA look at what Congress will be doing as lawmakers return from the August break:\n\nThe most urgent task for Congress is to avoid a government shutdown on Sept. 30, when federal funding runs out. And it\u2019s so far unclear if Republicans and Democrats will be able to agree on how to do that.\n\nCongress will have to pass a short-term spending measure to keep the government funded for a few weeks or months while they try to finish the full-year package. But Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass an extension, and Democrats will want significant concessions. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.\n\nThe Trump administration's efforts to claw back previously approved spending could also complicate the negotiations. Republicans passed legislation this summer that rescinded about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds and Trump notified Congress again on Friday that he will block $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid.\n\nDemocrats have warned that such efforts could tank the broader negotiations. \u201cTrump is rooting for a shutdown,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on social media Friday.\n\nSenators are expected to return to Washington right where they left off in early August \u2014 fighting over Trump\u2019s nominees.\n\nExasperated Republicans fled Washington for the month after making little headway with Senate Democrats over their nominations blockade, which has forced delays in confirmations and angered Trump as many of his administration\u2019s positions remain unfilled. Republican leaders called it quits after a rare Saturday session that ended with a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations and Trump posting on social media that Chuck Schumer could \u201cGO TO HELL!\u201d\n\nRepublicans now say they\u2019re ready to try and change Senate rules to get around the Democratic delays, and they are expected to spend the next several weeks discussing how that might work.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies, has pushed the president for months to support his sweeping bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose steep tariffs on countries that are fueling Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine by buying its oil, gas, uranium, and other exports. The legislation has the backing of 85 senators, but Trump has yet to endorse it, and Republican leaders have so far said they won\u2019t move without him.\n\nGraham has stepped up his calls after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy last month in hopes of a peace deal. Since then, Russia has continued to step up attacks on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have this thing moving in the right direction by the time we get back, then I think that plan B needs to kick in,\u201d Graham said of his bill in an interview with The Associated Press last month.\n\nHealth and Human Service Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will appear before the Senate Finance Committee to discuss his health care agenda on Thursday, less than a week after he ousted Susan Monarez as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several other top officials also resigned in protest.\n\nKennedy has tried to advance anti-vaccine policies that are contradicted by decades of scientific research. Monarez\u2019s lawyers said she refused \u201cto rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.\u201d\n\nLouisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Republican chairman of the HELP panel that oversees the CDC and a member of the Finance Committee, has called on the CDC to delay a meeting of outside experts who make recommendations on the use of vaccines until Congress can look into the issue.\n\nThe House left Washington in July amid disagreements among Republicans about whether they should force President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to release more information on the sex trafficking investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein. The pressure for more disclosure could only get more intense when lawmakers return.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky are pushing the House to take up their bill to force the Department of Justice to publicly release its investigation. They are planning a news conference this week joined by Epstein victims. The House Oversight Committee is also investigating the issue.\n\nDemocrats are eager to keep pressing on the Epstein files, especially after the Trump administration reneged on pledges for transparency. The case for years has been the subject of online conspiracy theories and speculation about who may have been involved or aware of the wealthy financier\u2019s abuse.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee will return from August recess with a slate of interviews lined up as part of its investigation into former President Joe Biden\u2019s mental state while in office. The committee has already conducted interviews and depositions with nearly a dozen former top Biden aides and members of the president\u2019s inner circle.\n\nThe Republican-led committee will hear from former top Biden staffers in September like Jeff Zients, Biden\u2019s final White House chief of staff, Karine Jean-Pierre, the former White House press secretary, and Andrew Bates, a top press aide.\n\nOversight Chair James Comer, R-Ky., has said public hearings and a full report can be expected sometime in the fall.\n\nCongress has discussed proposals for years to keep lawmakers from engaging in trading individual stocks, nodding to the idea that there\u2019s a potential conflict of interest when they are often privy to information and decisions that can dramatically move markets.\n\nThat push is now gaining momentum. A Senate committee has approved legislation from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri that would also extend the prohibition on stock trading to future presidents and vice presidents \u2014 while notably exempting Trump. In the House, several members are putting forward proposals and even threatening to maneuver around GOP leadership to force a vote.\n\nStill, there is plenty of resistance to the idea, including from many wealthy lawmakers who reap dividends from their portfolios.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Matt Brown and Joey Cappelletti contributed to this report."

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File)\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve's governing board has raised alarms among economists and legal experts who see it as the biggest threat to the central bank's independence in decades.\n\nThe consequences could impact most Americans' everyday lives: Economists worry that if Trump gets what he wants \u2014 a loyal Fed that sharply cuts short-term interest rates \u2014 the result would likely be higher inflation and, over time, higher borrowing costs for things like mortgages, car loans and business loans.\n\nTrump on Monday sought to fireLisa Cook, the first Black woman appointed to the Fed's seven-member governing board. It was the first time in the Fed's 112-year history that a president has tried to fire a governor.\n\nTrump said he was doing so because of allegations raised by one of his appointees that she has committed mortgage fraud.\n\nCook has argued in a lawsuit seeking to block her firing that the claims are a pretext for Trump's true goal: Gaining more control over the Fed. A court may decide next week whether to temporarily block Cook\u2019s firing while the case makes its way through the legal process.\n\nCook is accused of claiming two homes as primary residences in July 2021, before she joined the board, which could have led to a lower mortgage rate than if one had been classified as a second home or an investment property. She has suggested in her lawsuit that it may have been a clerical error but hasn\u2019t directly responded to the accusations.\n\nTrump and members of his administration have made no secret about their desire to exert more control over the Fed. Trump has repeatedly demanded that the central bank cut its key rate to as low as 1.3%, from its current level of 4.3%.\n\nBefore trying to fire Cook, Trump repeatedly attacked the Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting the short-term interest rate and threatened to fire him as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a majority very shortly, so that\u2019ll be good,\u201d Trump said Tuesday, a reference to the fact that if he is able to replace Cook his appointees will control the Fed's board by a 4-3 vote.\n\n\u201cThe particular case of Governor Cook is not as important as what this latest move shows about the escalation in the assaults on the Fed,\u201d said Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins and former adviser to Powell. \u201cIn my view, Fed independence really now hangs by a thread.\u201d\n\nSome economists do think the Fed should cut more quickly, though virtually none agree with Trump that it should do so by 3 percentage points. Powell has signaled the Fed is likely to cut by a quarter point in September.\n\nThe Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy. By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls \u2014 which it typically does when the economy falters \u2014 the Fed can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, growth, and hiring. When it raises the rate to combat the higher prices that come with inflation, it can weaken the economy and cause job losses.\n\nMost economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can take unpopular steps that elected officials are more likely to avoid. Economic research has shown that nations with independent central banks typically have lower inflation over time.\n\nElected officials like Trump, however, have much greater incentives to push for lower interest rates, which make it easier for Americans to buy homes and cars and would boost the economy in the short run.\n\nDouglas Elmendorf, an economist at Harvard and former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said that Trump's demand for the Fed to cut its key rate by 3 percentage points would overstimulate the economy, lifting consumer demand above what the economy can produce and boosting inflation \u2014 similar to what happened during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIf the Federal Reserve falls under control of the president, then we\u2019ll end up with higher inflation in this country probably for years to come,\u201d Elmendorf said.\n\nAnd while the Fed controls a short-term rate, financial markets determine longer-term borrowing costs for mortgages and other loans. And if investors worry that inflation will stay high, they will demand higher yields on government bonds, pushing up borrowing costs across the economy.\n\nIn Turkey, for example, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan forced the central bank to keep interest rates low in the early 2020s, even as inflation spiked to 85%. In 2023, Erdogan allowed the central bank more independence, which has helped bring down inflation, but short-term interest rates rose to 50% to fight inflation, and are still 46%.\n\nOther U.S. presidents have badgered the Fed. President Lyndon Johnson harassed then-Fed Chair William McChesney Martin in the mid-1960s to keep rates low as Johnson ramped up government spending on the Vietnam War and antipoverty programs. And Richard Nixon pressured then-Chair Arthur Burns to avoid rate hikes in the run-up to the 1972 election. Both episodes are widely blamed for leading to the stubbornly high inflation of the 1960s and '70s.\n\nTrump has also argued that the Fed should lower its rate to make it easier for the federal government to finance its tremendous $37 trillion debt load. Yet that threatens to distract the Fed from its congressional mandates of keeping inflation and unemployment low.\n\nPresidents do have some influence over the Fed through their ability to appoint members of the board, subject to Senate approval. But the Fed was created to be insulated from short-term political pressures. Fed governors are appointed to staggered, 14-year terms to ensure that no single president can appoint too many.\n\nJane Manners, a law professor at Fordham University, said there is a reason that Congress decided to create independent agencies like the Fed: They preferred \u201cdecisions that are made from a kind of objective, neutral vantage point grounded in expertise rather than decisions are that are wholly subject to political pressure.\u201d\n\nYet some Trump administration officials say they want more democratic accountability at the Fed.\n\nIn an interview with USA Today Vice President JD Vance said, \u201cWhat people who are saying the president has no authority here are effectively saying is that seven economists and lawyers should be able to make an incredibly critical decision for the American people with no democratic input.\u201d\n\nAnd Stephen Miran, a top White House economic adviser, wrote a paper last year advocating for a restructuring of the Fed, including making it much easier for a president to fire governors.\n\nThe \u201coverall goal of this design is delivering the economic benefits\u201d of an independent central bank, Miran wrote, \u201cwhile maintaining a level of accountability that a democratic society must demand.\" Trump has nominated Miran to the Fed's board to replace Adriana Kugler, who stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1.\n\nTrump has personally insulted Powell for months, but his administration now appears much more focused on the Fed\u2019s broader structure.\n\nThe Fed makes its interest rate decisions through a committee that consists of the seven governors, including Powell, as well as the 12 presidents of regional Fed banks in cities such as New York, Kansas City, and Atlanta. Five of those presidents vote on rates at each meeting. The New York Fed president has a permanent vote, while four others vote on a rotating basis.\n\nWhile the reserve banks' boards choose their presidents, the Fed board in Washington can vote to reject them. All 12 presidents will need to be reappointed and approved by the board in February, which could become more contentious if the board votes down one or more of the 12 presidents.\n\n\u201cThe nuclear scenario is ... the reappointment of the reserve bank presidents and interfering with that, (which) would be the signal that things are truly going off the rails,\" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics."

(AP Photo/Frank Eltman, File)\n\nRIVERHEAD, N.Y. -- When Maureen Brainard-Barnes\u2019 skeletal remains were found hidden in the roadside scrub near Long Island's Gilgo Beach in the winter of 2010, there was hardly any physical evidence that might help investigators find her killer, save for a single stray hair.\n\nBut at the time, extracting DNA evidence from the degraded strand was beyond the capabilities of crime labs. Investigators kept looking for other clues that might help them identify a suspected serial killer who had scattered women's bodies along a coastal parkway.\n\nThen, about seven years ago, investigators turned to Astrea Forensics, a California lab using new techniques to analyze old, highly degraded DNA samples \u2014 including rootless hairs like the one discovered with Brainard-Barnes' body.\n\nNow, that lab\u2019s work is the focus of a pivotal decision in the closely watched case.

After police arrived, Giuliani continued on his way and his vehicle was hit shortly after pulling onto the highway in a crash that was \u201centirely unrelated\u201d to the domestic violence incident, Ragusa told The Associated Press in an emailed statement.\n\nState police said troopers were investigating a domestic violence report on the southbound Interstate 93 highway shortly before 10 p.m. and observed the crash, which occurred on the northbound lanes.

Trump and his backers lost dozens of lawsuits claiming fraud, and numerous recounts, reviews and audits of the election results turned up no signs of significant wrongdoing or error.\n\nTwo former Georgia elections workers later won a $148 million defamation judgment against Giuliani. As they sought to collect the judgment, the former federal prosecutor was found in contempt of court and faced a trial this winter over the ownership of some of his assets. He ultimately struck a deal that let him keep his homes and various belongings, including prized World Series rings, in exchange for unspecified compensation and a promise to stop speaking ill of the ex-election workers. ____\n\nAssociated Press writer Jennifer Peltz in New York City contributed to this report."

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Delta Air Lines has agreed to pay $79 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed in 2020 after one of its airplanes that was experiencing engine trouble dumped its fuel over schoolyards and densely populated neighborhoods near Los Angeles.\n\nThe Delta jet had departed from Los Angeles to Shanghai on Jan. 14, 2020 when it needed to quickly return to Los Angeles International Airport. The Boeing 777-200 landed safely after circling back over Los Angeles while dumping 15,000 gallons of fuel to reach a safe landing weight.\n\nLos Angeles County firefighters were called to schools in the city of Cudahy where nearly 60 schoolchildren and teachers were examined for minor skin and lung irritations. None required hospitalization.\n\nShortly after, teachers from Park Avenue Elementary School in Cudahy filed a lawsuit against the airline, saying they were exposed to jet fuel that drizzled down like raindrops with \u201coverwhelming\u201d fumes. They described feeling the fuel on their clothes, skin and eyes. Later, several Cudahy homeowners filed a class-action suit.\n\nThe teachers said they sought medical treatment after the incident and experienced physical and emotional pain.\n\nDelta said in the lawsuit settlement reached Monday that one of the plane's two engines lost thrust shortly after takeoff and that the plane, which was carrying enough fuel for the 13-hour flight, exceeded its maximum landing weight by around 160,000 pounds.\n\nThe weight of a full load of fuel carries a risk of damaging a jetliner during landing \u2014 which can be expensive for an airline to fix. Even if there isn\u2019t damage, airlines try to avoid overweight landings because they are required to inspect planes, which puts them out of service.\n\nThe pilots decided to dump fuel \u201cto reduce the serious risks of flying and landing an overweight airplane on just one engine.\u201d the airline said in court documents.\n\nDelta said in court documents that it agreed to the settlement without any admission of liability to avoid the legal expenses of a trial and \u201cto eliminate the distraction and other burdens this litigation has caused to Delta\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nDelta did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment."

(AP Photo/Fran Ruchalski)\n\nWASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from carrying out speedy deportations of undocumented migrants detained in the interior of the United States.\n\nThe move is a setback for the Republican administration's efforts to expand the use of the federal expedited removal statute to quickly remove some migrants in the country illegally without appearing before a judge first.\n\nPresident Donald Trump promised to engineer a massive deportation operation during his 2024 campaign if voters returned him to the White House. And he set a goal of carrying out 1 million deportations a year in his second term.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., suggested the Trump administration's expanded use of the expedited removal of migrants is trampling on individuals' due process rights.\n\n\u201cIn defending this skimpy process, the Government makes a truly startling argument: that those who entered the country illegally are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment, but instead must accept whatever grace Congress affords them,\u201d Cobb wrote in a 48-page opinion issued Friday night. \u201cWere that right, not only noncitizens, but everyone would be at risk.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced shortly after Trump came to office in January that it was expanding the use of expedited removal, the fast-track deportation of undocumented migrants who have been in the U.S. less than two years.\n\nThe effort has triggered lawsuits by the American Civil Liberties Union and immigrant rights groups.\n\nBefore the Trump administration's push to expand such speedy deportations, expedited removal was only used for migrants who were stopped within 100 miles of the border and who had been in the U.S. for less than 14 days.\n\nCobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, didn't question the constitutionality of the expedited removal statute, or its application at the border.\n\n\u201cIt merely holds that in applying the statute to a huge group of people living in the interior of the country who have not previously been subject to expedited removal, the Government must afford them due process,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe added that \u201cprioritizing speed over all else will inevitably lead the Government to erroneously remove people via this truncated process.\u201d\n\nCobb earlier this month agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to expand fast-track deportations of immigrants who legally entered the U.S. under a process known as humanitarian parole \u2014 a ruling that could benefit hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nIn that case the judge said Homeland Security exceeded its statutory authority in its effort to expand expedited removal for many immigrants. The judge said those immigrants are facing perils that outweigh any harm from \u201cpressing pause\u201d on the administration\u2019s plans.\n\nSince May, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have positioned themselves in hallways to arrest people after judges accept government requests to dismiss deportation cases. After the arrests, the government renews deportation proceedings but under fast-track authority.\n\nAlthough fast-track deportations can be put on hold by filing an asylum claim, people may be unaware of that right and, even if they are, can be swiftly removed if they fail an initial screening."

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth)\n\nNEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka set up a high-profile showdown between two past title winners in the U.S. Open\u2019s fourth round with victories Saturday.\n\n\u201cEveryone will be watching,\u201d Venus Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s what tennis needs.\u201d\n\nTheir meeting on Monday, with a quarterfinal berth at stake, is a rematch from 2019, when Gauff was a 15-year-old making her main-draw debut at Flushing Meadows and Osaka was the reigning champion.\n\nOsaka won that one in straight sets, then consoled a teary Gauff on the sideline and encouraged her to speak to an Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd that was pulling for the young American.\n\n\u201cI kind of see her as a little sister,\u201d Osaka said Saturday, \u201cso it's kind of cool to be playing her here again.\u201d\n\nShe advanced to her first fourth-round match at any major since the 2021 Australian Open by eliminating No. 15 seed Daria Kasatkina 6-0, 4-6, 6-3 at Louis Armstrong Stadium, after Gauff made it that far at the U.S. Open for the fourth consecutive year with a 6-3, 6-1 victory over No. 28 Magdalena Frech at Ashe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a really long journey,\u201d Osaka said during her on-court interview, \u201cbut I'm glad to be here now.\u201d\n\nOsaka, who was born in Japan and moved with her family to the United States as a kid, joked to the Armstrong fans: \u201cCan somebody come to the match and cheer for me? It's kind of tough playing an American here, but I hope you guys adopted me, as well.\u201d\n\nSo much has happened to both Osaka and Gauff since that headline-worthy encounter six years ago in New York.\n\nThe No. 3-seeded Gauff, 21, is now a two-time Grand Slam champ, including at the U.S. Open in 2023, and a real star.\n\nNo. 23 Osaka, 27, owns four major titles \u2014 including at the U.S. Open in 2018 and 2020 \u2014 and has been ranked No. 1. She was among the athletes at the forefront of conversations about mental health, opening up at the 2021 French Open about dealing with anxiety and depression, then taking a series of breaks from the tour.\n\n\u201cNaomi and I, we aren\u2019t super close or anything, but we\u2019re definitely friendly with each other,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cI support her from afar in all the things that she\u2019s done \u2014 on and off the court.\u201d\n\nGauff has won three of their four head-to-head matches since that unforgettable night in Ashe.\n\n\u201cI remember it was a tough moment for me, because it was a hyped-up match. ... I guess I put way too much pressure on myself, thinking I maybe had a chance in that moment to actually do something, which I definitely did, but I think it was just I felt more expectation than I should than maybe belief,\u201d Gauff said.\n\n\u201cIt would be a cool, kind of, deja vu type of situation,\u201d Gauff said Saturday, \u201cbut hopefully it will be a different result.\u201d\n\nWilliams and Leylah Fernandez reached the third round of women's doubles with a 7-6 (1), 6-1 win over Ulrikke Eikeri and Eri Hozumi. The 45-year-old Williams is playing doubles at a Grand Slam tournament for the first time since 2022.\n\nNo. 1 Jannik Sinner dropped a set in New York for the first time since last year's quarterfinals but righted himself for a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 victory over No. 27 Denis Shapovalov. Other men moving on included Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime, who knocked off third-seeded Alexander Zverev, and No. 10 Lorenzo Musetti, whose opponent in an all-Italian match, No. 23 Flavio Cobolli, stopped because of a painful right arm. Women into the fourth round included No. 2 Iga Swiatek, who rallied from down 5-1 in the first set to win, and No. 11 Karolina Muchova \u2014 a U.S. Open semifinalist in 2023 and 2024 and the woman who beat Williams in the first round this year.\n\nNovak Djokovic, Taylor Fritz, Aryna Sabalenka and Jessica Pegula are among the players who will be attempting to reach the quarterfinals by winning Sunday.\n\n___\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP\u2019s tennis writer since 2002.

President Donald Trump is pressing for changes in the stories the Smithsonian museums tell about America. He wants U.S. history cast in a more positive light. (AP Photo/Calvin Woodward)\n\nWASHINGTON -- In an afternoon's walk through ground zero of Americana \u2014 the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History \u2014 objects around every corner invite one question: What could possibly be more American than this?\n\nWhat could be more American than that enormous Star-Spangled Banner in all its timeworn glory? Or more American than Dorothy's ruby slippers from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d?\n\nAnd what could be more American than a reckoning with the nation's sins, as illustrated by shackles representing slavery and photos of Japanese Americans confined to detention camps in World War II? It's in authoritarian countries, like Russia, where history is scrubbed.\n\nIn myriad ways, the museum explores \u201cthe complexity of our past,\" in accord with its mission statement. President Donald Trump wants a simpler tale told. He wants this and the other Smithsonian museums to mirror American pride, power and achievement without all the darkness, and he threatens to hold back money if they don't get with that program.\n\nOn social media, Trump complained that at the Smithsonian museums, which are free to visit and get most of their money from the government, \u201ceverything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been \u2014 Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the history museum reflects bountiful successes, whether on the battlefield, from the kitchens and factories of food pioneers, on the musical stage, in the movies or on other fronts of creativity and industriousness. The American Enterprise exhibit, for one, has a wall filled with the stories of successful Americans.\n\nOn this wandering tour you can see navigational implements used by Blackbeard, the terrifying pirate, from his early 1700s raids on the Atlantic coast. You see the hat Abraham Lincoln wore to Ford's Theatre the night of his assassination, George Washington\u2019s ceremonial uniform, Warren Harding\u2019s fine red silk pajamas from the early 1900s, the first car to travel across the country, and a $100,000 bill.\n\nYou can see the original light bulbs of the American genius, Thomas Edison. A much earlier genius, the founding father Benjamin Franklin, is presented both as a gifted inventor and a slave owner who publicly came to denounce slavery yet never freed his own.\n\nThose nuances and ambiguities may not be long for this world. Still on display at the history museum are artifacts and documents of American ingenuity, subjugation, generosity, racism, grit, cruelty, verve, playfulness, corruption, heroism, and cultural appropriation.\n\nLike most museums, the focus is not on the future.\n\nEven so, there is plenty to provoke the Republican president.\n\nIn the \u201cGreat Debate\u201d of an American democracy exhibition, a wall is emblazoned with large words such as \u201cPrivilege\u201d and \u201cSlavery.\u201d The museum presents fulsome tributes to the contributions of immigrants and narratives about the racist landscape that many encountered.\n\nExhibits address \u201cfood justice,\" the exploitation of Filipinos after the United States annexed their land and the network of oppressive Native American boarding schools from which Jim Thorpe emerged and became one of the greatest athletes of all time.\n\nHawaii\u2019s last sovereign before its annexation by the U..S. in the 1890s, Queen Lili\u2018uokalani, is quoted on a banner as asking: \u201cIs the AMERICAN REPUBLIC of STATES to DEGENERATE and become a COLONIZER?\u201d\n\nA ukulele on display was made around 1890 by a sugar laborer who worked on the kingdom\u2019s American plantations before a U.S.-backed coup overthrew the monarchy. Museum visitors are told the new instrument was held up by the monarchs as a symbol of anti-colonial independence.\n\n\u201cUkuleles are both a product of U.S. imperialism and a potent symbol of Native Hawaiian resistance,\u201d says the accompanying text.\n\nAt the Greek-godlike statue of George Washington, the text hints at his complexities and stops short of the total reverence that totalitarian leaders get.\n\nNoting that \u201cmodern scholarship focuses on the fallible man rather than the marble hero,\u201d the text says Washington's image \u201cis still used for inspiration, patriotism and commercial gain\u201d and that \u201che continues to hold a place for many as a symbolic \u2018father\u2019 of the country.\u201d\n\nOn this visit, conservators behind a big window are seen sweeping tiny brushes on ancient wooden pieces. Their patriotic work proceeds at a snail's pace.\n\nThe team is restoring the gunboat Philadelphia, part of a small fleet that engaged the British navy at the Battle of Valcour Island in Lake Champlain in 1776, delaying Britain's effort to cut off the New England colonies and buying time for the Continental Army to prepare for its decisive victory at Saratoga.\n\nThe commander of the gunboats in the Valcour battle later became America\u2019s greatest traitor, Benedict Arnold. The British damaged the Philadelphia so badly it sank an hour after the battle, then lay underwater for 160 years. It's being restored for next year's celebrations of America's 250th year.\n\n\u201cThe Philadelphia is a symbol of how citizens of a newly formed nation came together, despite overwhelming odds against their success,\u201d said Jennifer Jones, the project's director. \u201cThis boat\u2019s fragile condition is symbolic of our democracy; it requires the nation\u2019s attention and vigilance to preserve it for future generations.\u201d\n\nDemocracy's fragility is considered in a section of the museum about the limits of presidential power. That's where references to Trump's two impeachments were removed in July for updating, and were restored this month.\n\n\u201cOn December 18, 2019, the House impeached Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,\u201d one label now states. \u201cOn January 13, 2021, Donald Trump became the first president to be impeached twice,\" says another. \"The charge was incitement of insurrection based on his challenge of the 2020 election results and on his speech on January 6.\u201d His Senate acquittals are duly noted.\n\nIt's a just-the-facts take on a matter that has driven the country so deeply apart. The history museum doesn't offer answers for that predicament. Instead, it asks questions throughout its halls on the fundamentals of Americanism.\n\n\u201cHow should Americans remember their Revolution and the founding of the nation?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does patriotism look like?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow diverse should the citizenry be?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we need to share a common national story?\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lynn Berry contributed to this report."

(AP Photo/Bruce Kluckhohn)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS -- The bad news began in the early days of summer and has never seemed to end in this corner of the Upper Midwest.\n\nThere was the deadly attack on state politicians in the Minneapolis suburbs. The gunfire that erupted during a gathering at a popular city picnic spot, leaving one person dead and five injured. On Tuesday a shooter sprayed bullets on a sidewalk behind a Catholic high school, killing one person and injuring six.\n\nThen, on Wednesday, police swarmed another Catholic school a few miles away.\n\nIn what Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara called a \u201c truly unthinkable tragedy,\u201d a shooter fired into a church where some 200 children from Annunciation Catholic School were at Mass. Two of them were killed, and 18 people were wounded.\n\n\u201cThis has been a tough summer for Minnesota,\u201d acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson said Thursday.\n\nEven as most categories of crime continue to fall in Minneapolis after a surge that followed the 2020 killing of George Floyd, the season has seen a spike in violence that repeatedly led to armored vehicles being seen rolling through the streets carrying police in full combat gear.\n\nIn the latest violence, the shooter, who authorities say was consumed by thoughts of killing children, fired more than 100 rounds through the church\u2019s stained-glass windows.\n\nAuthorities said there was no clear motive, though 23-year-old Robin Westman, who died by suicide at the church, left behind videos and writings that idolized mass killers and vented fury at a litany of humanity, from Black people to Mexicans to Christians to Jews.\n\n\"In short, the shooter appeared to hate all of us,\" Thompson said.\n\nIn the writings Westman spoke of profound depression and longtime plans to carry out a mass shooting.\n\n\u201cI know this is wrong, but I can\u2019t seem to stop myself,\u201d Westman wrote.\n\nOn Thursday, looking to reassure Minneapolis residents, Gov. Tim Walz ordered state law enforcement officers to work with local police to keep watch over schools and churches.\n\n\u201cBy coming together, local and state law enforcement are sending a clear message: The people of Minneapolis are not alone,\u201d Department of Public Safety Commissioner Bob Jacobson said in a statement. \u201cThe loss Minneapolis is experiencing right now is felt across our entire state,\u201d\n\nThat loss is something Minneapolis has felt repeatedly this summer.\n\nPeople were stunned when a man posing as a police officer hunted a series of state lawmakers in the Minneapolis suburbs in the early hours of June 14. Police say Vance Boelter fatally shot former House speaker Melissa Hortman, 55, long one of the state\u2019s most prominent Democrats, along with her husband, Mark. He also allegedly shot Democratic state Sen.

    "content": "Tennessee authorities say a cold case investigation reveals that a sheriff who inspired a Hollywood movie about an organized crime-busting law enforcement officer actually killed his wife in 1967 and led people to believe she was murdered by his enemies\n\nA late Tennessee sheriff who inspired a Hollywood movie about a law enforcement officer who took on organized crime killed his wife in 1967 and led people to believe she was murdered by his enemies, authorities in Tennessee said Friday.\n\nThe finding will likely shock many who grew up as Buford Pusser fans and watched the 1973 \u201cWalking Tall\u201d movie that immortalized him as a tough but fair sheriff with zero tolerance for crime, authorities said.\n\nThere is enough evidence that if then-McNairy County Sheriff Buford Pusser were alive today, prosecutors would present an indictment to the grand jury for the murder of Pauline Mullins Pusser, said Mark Davidson, the district attorney for Tennessee\u2019s 25th judicial district. Investigators also uncovered signs she suffered from domestic violence.\n\nProsecutors worked with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which began reexamining decades-old files on Pauline's death in 2022 as part of its regular review of cold cases, agency director David Rausch said. Agents found inconsistencies between Buford Pusser's version of events and the physical evidence, received a tip about a potential murder weapon and exhumed Pauline's body for an autopsy.\n\nAuthorities acknowledged the news may shock many who grew up as Buford Pusser's fans and watched the 1973 \u201cWalking Tall\u201d movie he inspired or the 2004 remake. Many officers joined law enforcement because of his story, Davidson said. The sheriff died in a car crash seven years after his wife's death.\n\n\u201cThis case is not about tearing down a legend. It is about giving dignity and closure to Pauline and her family and ensuring that the truth is not buried with time,\u201d Davidson said at a news conference streamed on Facebook. \u201cThe truth matters. Justice matters. Even 58 years later. Pauline deserves both.\u201d\n\nThe case dates to Aug. 12, 1967. Buford Pusser got a call in the early morning hours about a disturbance. He reported that his wife volunteered to ride along with him as he responded. Buford Pusser said that shortly after they passed Hope Methodist Church, a car pulled up and fired several times into the vehicle, killing Pauline and injuring the sheriff. Buford Pusser spent 18 days in the hospital and required several surgeries to recover. The case was built largely on his own statement and closed quickly, Rausch said.\n\nDuring the reexamination of the case, Dr. Michael Revelle, an emergency medicine physical and medical examiner, studied postmortem photographs, crime scene photographs, notes made by the medical examiner at the time and Buford Pusser's statements and concluded that Pauline was actually more likely that not shot outside the car and then placed inside it.\n\nHe found that cranial trauma suffered by Pauline didn't match crime scene photographs of the car's interior. Blood spatter on the hood outside the car contradicted Buford Pusser's statements. The gunshot wound on his cheek was in fact a close-contact wound and not one fired from long range, as Buford Pusser described, and was likely self-inflicted, Revelle concluded.\n\nPauline's autopsy revealed she had a broken nose that had healed prior to her death. Davidson said statements from people who were around at the time she died support the conclusion that she was a victim of domestic violence.\n\nPauline's younger brother, Griffon Mullins, said the investigation gave him closure. He said in a recorded video played at the news conference that their other sister died without knowing what happened to Pauline and he is grateful he will die knowing.\n\n\u201cYou would fall in love with her because she was a people person. And of course, my family would always go to Pauline if they had an issue or they needed some advice and she was always there for them,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was just a sweet person. I loved her with all my heart.\u201d\n\nMullins said he knew there was some trouble in Pauline's marriage, but she wasn't one to talk about her problems. For that reason, Mullins said he was \u201cnot totally shocked.\u201d\n\nThe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation plans to make the entire file, which exceeds 1,000 pages, available to the public by handing it over to the University of Tennessee at Martin once it finishes with redactions. The school will create an online, searchable database for the case. Until then, members of the public can make appointments to review it in person or can purchase a copy, said university Chancellor Yancy Freeman Sr."

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Since sending the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington, President Donald Trump has openly mused about sending troops to some of the nation\u2019s most Democratic cities \u2014 including Chicago and Baltimore \u2014 claiming they are needed to crack down on crime.\n\nThe threats to expand a federal intervention have legal experts and some military officials raising concerns that Trump is considering novel ways to use National Guard troops in American cities that could set up conflicts not seen since the civil rights era.\n\nThough most violent crime has fallen in recent years in the cities Trump has called out, the Republican president said Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker \u201cshould be calling me, and he should be saying, \u2018Can you send over the troops please?\u2019 It\u2019s out of control.\u201d\n\nWhether Trump can repeat what he\u2019s done in LA and the nation's capital \u2014 call up the National Guard and have it assist a surge of federal law enforcement and immigration officers \u2014 is an open question and likely to become a point of contention should he press forward.\n\nHere's a look at how Trump has used troops in U.S. cities, what the law allows and what could come next:\n\nTrump first deployed troops to Los Angeles in early June over Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s objections by putting the California National Guard under federal jurisdiction, known as Title 10, to protect federal property from protests over immigration raids.\n\nBesides 4,000 Guard members, Trump later sent 700 active duty Marines, and California sued over the intervention. The Guard went on to help protect officers during immigration arrests.\n\nWhile Trump pushed the limits of the law, the lawsuit centers on whether the president was allowed to use the Guard to closely shadow federal law enforcement and whether that runs afoul of the prohibition on using the military as law enforcement, known as the Posse Comitatus Act, said Todd Huntley, director of the National Security Law Program at the Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nMeanwhile, the unique status of the District of Columbia National Guard \u2014 Trump is their commander in chief \u2014 means he has been able to use it for everything from armed patrols to trash cleanup without any legal issues. Because it is on state and not federal orders, legal restrictions on law enforcement don\u2019t come into effect.\n\n\u201cWhere we have a big question mark\u201d is whether \u201cthe governor of a state has to consent to the sending of troops to his state,\u201d said Huntley, a retired Navy captain and judge advocate.\n\nThe Trump administration is planning to surge officers to the nation\u2019s third-largest city for an immigration crackdown, two U.S. officials said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security asked Naval Station Great Lakes outside Chicago for support on immigration operations, including with facilities and logistics, the base said this week. The Illinois National Guard and the base said they had not received requests regarding a mobilization of troops to Chicago.\n\nIf Trump wants the freedom to use the National Guard as he pleases in Chicago, the easiest legal path is to invoke the Insurrection Act \u2014 a vaguely worded 1792 law that allows the president to deploy federal troops inside the U.S. to conduct law enforcement, an exception to the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act.\n\nThe law offers sweeping powers to the president, envisioning armed conflict within the United States.\n\n\u201cThe orders would be given by him \u2026 and the governor of the receiving state would not have a say in whether he allows them into the state or not or allows them to conduct a mission in the state,\u201d Huntley said.\n\nHowever, Huntley calls this \u201cthe nuclear option.\u201d\n\nA D.C. National Guard official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said invoking the Insurrection Act over a broad topic like crime could allow the Guard to be deployed indefinitely.\n\nAnother possibility is Trump deploying the D.C. Guard, which he commands, to another state, the official said.\n\nIf the D.C. Guard is put on federal orders \u2014 something Trump has the power to do \u2014 it could lead to some rare situations, including federalized D.C. Guardsmen sent to another state that in turn could activate its own Guard as a counter, Huntley said.\n\nThe possibility is not without precedent.\n\n\u201cThe resolution of that could be basically what we saw in Alabama during the civil rights era. To take the ability of that state governor of using state National Guard forces away, the president could simply federalize them,\u201d Huntley said.\n\nIn 1963, President John F. Kennedy federalized the Alabama National Guard as part of the now-famous standoff with Gov. George Wallace, who refused to step aside and allow Black students to integrate the University of Alabama. Wallace eventually relented.\n\nIn an executive order signed Monday, Trump ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to create \u201ca specialized unit\" within the D.C. Guard \"dedicated to ensuring public safety and order.\u201d\n\nHe also directed Hegseth to ensure every state\u2019s Guard is ready to assist federal and local law enforcement in \"quelling civil disturbances and ensuring the public safety and order\u201d when needed. It also calls for each to have units \u201creasonably available for rapid mobilization.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon has not given more details of what Trump's order will mean for the National Guard. A defense official confirmed that Hegseth\u2019s office was aware of the order and that they were reviewing it and its specific requirements.\n\nAll state Guards already have a \u201creaction force\u201d that is aimed at responding to a wide variety of incidents with an initial force of 75-125 personnel within eight hours and a follow-on force of up to 375 personnel within 24 hours, according to a National Guard fact sheet.\n\nAnd the D.C. National Guard already has a unit that is made up entirely of soldiers trained as military police."

Lipman ordered a new trial for Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith. They were found guilty in October 2024 of obstruction of justice through witness tampering in the January 2023 beating of Nichols after he fled a traffic stop. Two other officers involved in the beating pleaded guilty and avoided trial.\n\nLipman wrote that U.S. District Judge Mark S. Norris, who presided over the trial, raised \u201cthe risk of bias\u201d when he commented in May that at least one of the officers could be in a gang, and that gang may have been responsible for shooting his law clerk.\n\nLipman's order also said an assistant U.S. attorney recalled that Norris told her shortly after the shooting that the Memphis Police Department was \u201cinfiltrated to the top with gang members.\u201d\n\nNorris recused himself from the case in June, just days before scheduled sentencings for the five officers. He has declined comment.\n\nIf the case heads to trial again, defense attorneys, prosecutors, the officers and Nichols' family will have to relive the brutal beating and the grueling legal battle that has followed. It is unclear when a new trial would take place, again putting Memphis in the spotlight for a death that sparked a federal civil rights investigation into its police.\n\nHere is a look at the case, and what's next.\n\nOn Jan. 7, 2023, officers yanked Nichols from his car and then pepper-sprayed and hit the 29-year-old Black man with a Taser.

I think it's very insulting to a country when you say you're not going to take your students,\" Trump told the Daily Caller, a right-wing news outlet.\n\n\"You know, I get along with China,\" he added. \"China's paying us a lot of money right now.

The two sides are currently in a tariffs truce.\n\nThe White House has said that those 600,000 student visas will be issued over the next two years, in line with numbers issued in previous years.\n\nTrump told the Daily Caller he did not expect anything in return for allowing students into the country.\n\n\"No, I just think it's, I think it's, I think what we're doing is the right thing to do,\" he said. \"It's good to get along with countries, not bad, especially, you know, nuclear-powered countries.\""

I think it's very insulting to a country when you say you're not going to take your students,\" Trump told the Daily Caller, a right-wing news outlet.\n\n\"You know, I get along with China,\" he added. \"China's paying us a lot of money right now. They're paying us hundreds of millions of dollars.\"\n\nIn May, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he would \"aggressively\" revoke Chinese visas, especially \"those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields\".\n\nThe announcement came as relations between Washington and Beijing continued a downhill trend, prompted by a tit-for-tat trade war that was sparked by Trump's tariffs. The two sides are currently in a tariffs truce.\n\nThe White House has said that those 600,000 student visas will be issued over the next two years, in line with numbers issued in previous years.\n\nTrump told the Daily Caller he did not expect anything in return for allowing students into the country.\n\n\"No, I just think it's, I think it's, I think what we're doing is the right thing to do,\" he said. \"It's good to get along with countries, not bad, especially, you know, nuclear-powered countries.\""

    "content": "Canada's first lunar rover looks to future space exploration\n\n18 hours ago Share Save Ali Abbas Ahmadi BBC News, Toronto Share Save\n\nCanadian Space Agency A computer generated image of what the lunar vehicle could look like on the Moon\n\nIn a shopping plaza an hour outside Toronto, flanked by a day spa and a shawarma joint, sits a two-storey building with blue tinted windows reflecting the summer sun. It is the modest headquarters of Canadensys Aerospace, where Canada is charting its first trip to the Moon. Canadensys is developing the first-ever Canadian-built rover for exploring the Earth's only natural satellite, in what will be the first Canadian-led planetary exploration endeavour. Models, maps and posters of outer space line the office walls, while engineers wearing anti-static coats work on unfamiliar-looking machines. Sending this rover to the Moon is part of the company's \"broader strategy of really moving humanity off the Earth\", Dr Christian Sallaberger, Canadensys' president and CEO, told the BBC. Learning about the Moon - which is seen to have the potential to become a base for further space exploration - is the \"logical first step\", he said. \"People get all excited about science fiction films when they come out. You know, Star Wars or Star Trek. This is the real thing.\"\n\nPrototypes of the lunar rover, both designed and built by Canadensys\n\nThe Canadian vehicle is part of Nasa's Artemis programme, which aims to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon. As part of that overarching goal, this rover aims to find water and measure radiation levels on the lunar surface in preparation for future manned missions, and survive multiple lunar nights (equivalent to about 14 days on Earth). The rover will also demonstrate Canadian technology, building on Canada's history in space. Canada was the third country to launch a satellite, designed the Canadarm robotic arms for the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station, and is known for astronauts such as Chris Hadfield and Jeremy Hansen - the latter of whom will orbit the Moon on the Artemis II mission next year. The 35kg rover is scheduled to be launched as part of a Nasa initiative in 2029 at the earliest. It will land on the Moon's south polar region - one of the most inhospitable places on the lunar surface. The vehicle does not have a name yet. The Canadian Space Agency held an online competition to select one, and is expected to announce the winner in the future.\n\nCanadensys President Christian Sallaberger said he is excited to be playing a role in humanity's quest to explore space\n\nCanadensys is currently working on several prototypes of the rover. The final vehicle, Mr Sallaberger said, would be assembled shortly before launch. Each component is tested to ensure it can survive the Moon's harsh conditions. Temperature is one of the main obstacles. Lunar nights can plummet to -200C (-328F) and rise to a scorching daytime of 100C (212F). \"It's one of the biggest engineering challenges we have because it's not so much even surviving the cold temperature, but swinging between very cold and very hot,\" he said. Designing the wheels is another challenge, as the Moon's surface is covered with a sticky layer of fragmented rock and dust called regolith. \"Earth dirt, if you look at it microscopically, has been weathered off. It's more or less in a round shape; but on the Moon the lunar dirt soil is all jagged,\" Mr Sallaberger said. \"It's like Velcro dirt,\" he said, noting it \"just gums up mechanisms\".\n\nEngineers Misha Hartmann (L) and Adam Abdulahad work on a prototype of the rover at the Canadensys headquarters\n\nThe search for water on the lunar surface is especially exciting, considering the Moon was generally thought to be bone dry following the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 70s, the US human spaceflight programme led by Nasa. That perception changed in 2008, Dr Gordon Osinski, the mission's chief scientist, told the BBC, when researchers re-analysed some Apollo mission samples and found particles of water. Around the same time, space crafts observing the Moon detected its presence from orbit. It has yet to be verified on the ground and many questions remain, the professor at Western University in London, Ontario, said. \"Is it like a patch of ice the size of this table?

    "content": "Canada's first lunar rover looks to future space exploration\n\n18 hours ago Share Save Ali Abbas Ahmadi BBC News, Toronto Share Save\n\nCanadian Space Agency A computer generated image of what the lunar vehicle could look like on the Moon\n\nIn a shopping plaza an hour outside Toronto, flanked by a day spa and a shawarma joint, sits a two-storey building with blue tinted windows reflecting the summer sun. It is the modest headquarters of Canadensys Aerospace, where Canada is charting its first trip to the Moon. Canadensys is developing the first-ever Canadian-built rover for exploring the Earth's only natural satellite, in what will be the first Canadian-led planetary exploration endeavour. Models, maps and posters of outer space line the office walls, while engineers wearing anti-static coats work on unfamiliar-looking machines. Sending this rover to the Moon is part of the company's \"broader strategy of really moving humanity off the Earth\", Dr Christian Sallaberger, Canadensys' president and CEO, told the BBC. Learning about the Moon - which is seen to have the potential to become a base for further space exploration - is the \"logical first step\", he said. \"People get all excited about science fiction films when they come out. You know, Star Wars or Star Trek. This is the real thing.\"\n\nPrototypes of the lunar rover, both designed and built by Canadensys\n\nThe Canadian vehicle is part of Nasa's Artemis programme, which aims to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon. As part of that overarching goal, this rover aims to find water and measure radiation levels on the lunar surface in preparation for future manned missions, and survive multiple lunar nights (equivalent to about 14 days on Earth). The rover will also demonstrate Canadian technology, building on Canada's history in space. Canada was the third country to launch a satellite, designed the Canadarm robotic arms for the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station, and is known for astronauts such as Chris Hadfield and Jeremy Hansen - the latter of whom will orbit the Moon on the Artemis II mission next year. The 35kg rover is scheduled to be launched as part of a Nasa initiative in 2029 at the earliest. It will land on the Moon's south polar region - one of the most inhospitable places on the lunar surface. The vehicle does not have a name yet. The Canadian Space Agency held an online competition to select one, and is expected to announce the winner in the future.\n\nCanadensys President Christian Sallaberger said he is excited to be playing a role in humanity's quest to explore space\n\nCanadensys is currently working on several prototypes of the rover. The final vehicle, Mr Sallaberger said, would be assembled shortly before launch. Each component is tested to ensure it can survive the Moon's harsh conditions. Temperature is one of the main obstacles. Lunar nights can plummet to -200C (-328F) and rise to a scorching daytime of 100C (212F). \"It's one of the biggest engineering challenges we have because it's not so much even surviving the cold temperature, but swinging between very cold and very hot,\" he said. Designing the wheels is another challenge, as the Moon's surface is covered with a sticky layer of fragmented rock and dust called regolith. \"Earth dirt, if you look at it microscopically, has been weathered off. It's more or less in a round shape; but on the Moon the lunar dirt soil is all jagged,\" Mr Sallaberger said. \"It's like Velcro dirt,\" he said, noting it \"just gums up mechanisms\".\n\nEngineers Misha Hartmann (L) and Adam Abdulahad work on a prototype of the rover at the Canadensys headquarters\n\nThe search for water on the lunar surface is especially exciting, considering the Moon was generally thought to be bone dry following the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 70s, the US human spaceflight programme led by Nasa. That perception changed in 2008, Dr Gordon Osinski, the mission's chief scientist, told the BBC, when researchers re-analysed some Apollo mission samples and found particles of water. Around the same time, space crafts observing the Moon detected its presence from orbit. It has yet to be verified on the ground and many questions remain, the professor at Western University in London, Ontario, said. \"Is it like a patch of ice the size of this table? The size of a hockey rink? Most people think, like in the Arctic, it's probably more like grains of ice mixed in with the soil,\" he said. Water on the Moon could have huge implications for more sustainable exploration.

    "content": "White House defends Robert F Kennedy Jr amid CDC turmoil\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine critic, is under pressure after his policies as health secretary are being criticised across party lines\n\nAt least three senior CDC leaders have since resigned over frustrations about Kennedy's leadership and vaccine policy. The unease led to some lawmakers calling for his resignation.\n\nEarlier this week, CDC Chief Dr Susan Monarez was fired because she was \"not aligned with the president's agenda\", the White House said in a statement, and was replaced by RFK Jr's deputy Jim O'Neill.\n\nOn Friday, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called Kennedy, also known as RFK Jr, \"a crown jewel of this administration\".\n\nThe White House is defending Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr after a chaotic week at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that led to calls for his removal.\n\nMiller called Kennedy \"one of the world's foremost voices, advocates and experts on public health\", and said he is working hard to restore the credibility and the integrity of CDC, which is one of the world's most foremost public health bodies.\n\nKennedy does not hold a medical degree and had a background in law before Trump tapped him to lead the department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The department oversees a variety of US health agencies, including the CDC.\n\nThe BBC reached out to HHS and representatives for Kennedy.\n\nThe recent turmoil follows the CDC permanently firing 600 employees earlier this month, according to a union representing the workers.\n\nThe wide-ranging layoffs include employees working on the government's response to infectious diseases, including bird flu, as well as those researching environmental hazards and handling public record requests for information.\n\nSince taking office, Kennedy, a vaccine critic, has made a number of funding cuts and changes to how the US recommends and regulates immunizations that have angered public health experts.\n\nHe previously helped run an anti-vaccine group, and has repeatedly stated widely debunked claims about vaccine harm.\n\nFormer CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr Debra Houry, one of the officials who resigned this week, told the BBC's Newshour radio programme that Kennedy's policies lacked scientific integrity.\n\n\"I am extremely worried that with continued resignations, terminations, retirements, all because of what's going on through some of these policies, that we are not going to have the capacity to continue to do good science, to respond to an outbreak and to prevent chronic diseases,\" she said.\n\nShe added that the worst case result of Kennedy's policies is the disruption of the vaccine schedule for children, which could lead to the spread of \"preventable diseases throughout the US again, like polio and measles.\"\n\nSeveral Democrat senators have called for Kennedy's resignation, including Georgia's Jon Ossoff - who called the health secretary a \"quack\" - and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"Donald Trump knew Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would be a disastrous pick to lead health care in America and he nominated him anyway. Donald Trump made this mistake and now he must fire RFK Jr. immediately,\" Schumer said in a written statement.\n\nSeveral Republicans also expressed unease over the developments at the CDC, with Maine Senator Susan Collins saying there was \"no basis\" to remove Monarez from her position. She asked for a congressional hearing to examine what is happening at the agency.\n\nFellow Republican senator Bill Cassidy, who leads the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee - which vetted Kennedy's appointment - said the panel would conduct oversight over the high-profile departures.\n\nHe also urged a delay on a vaccine advisory committee hearing scheduled for next month, saying there were allegations that the panel lacked a \"scientific process\".\n\n\"If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership,\" he said.\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr wrote an open letter to CDC employees after the removal of Monarez and the departure of several top officials, according to US media.\n\n\"I am committed to working with you to restore trust, transparency, and credibility to the CDC. Your daily efforts\u2014often unseen\u2014save lives,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Reform does not diminish your work; it strengthens it. The American people are ready to believe in this agency again if we show them that integrity, accountability, and science guide every decision,\" Kennedy added.\n\nThe health secretary also said that he wants to rebuild the CDC into \"a guardian of America's health and security.\""

    "content": "Trump ends Secret Service protection for Harris\n\nThe move comes just before Harris embarks on a national book tour to promote \"107 Days\" - a memoir of her short-lived and ultimately unsuccessful 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nHer protection had been quietly extended for another year by a directive signed by her former boss but was revoked by Trump in a memo dated on Thursday, according to the memo seen by the BBC.\n\nAs a former vice-president, Ms Harris was entitled under law to receive six months of security after leaving office in January, which was due to expire in July.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has cancelled Secret Service protection for Kamala Harris, which had been extended by Joe Biden before he left office, according to one of her advisers.\n\nA copy of a letter seen by the BBC, dated 28 August, directs the Secret Service to \"discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorised by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law\" for Harris from 1 September.\n\nA senior White House official confirmed the move.\n\nSources familiar with the situation told CBS, the BBC's US news partner, that a recent threat assessment found nothing alarming that would warrant extending her detail past the legally-mandated six month period she was entitled to.\n\nIn 2008, the US Congress enacted a law permitting the Secret Service to provide protection to former Vice Presidents, their spouses and any children under the age of 16 after leaving office.\n\nIt has been just over seven months since Harris left office at the end ofJoe Biden's administration in January.\n\nHarris' husband, Doug Emhoff, had his own protections end on 1 July at the end of the legally mandated period.\n\nHarris will lose the agents that are assigned to protect her and her property in Los Angeles, as well as proactive threat intelligence carried out to identify and pre-empt any potential threats.\n\nThe price of similar protections, if privately funded, could add up to millions of dollars per year.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass have both expressed outrage at the announcement.\n\n\"This is another act of revenge following a lost list of political retaliation in the form of firings, the revoking of security clearances and more,\" Ms Bass told CNN, who were first to report the story.\n\nThe LA mayor said this puts Harris in danger and she would make sure she was safe in Los Angeles.\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has revoked Secret Service protections for a number of people, including Hunter and Ashley Biden, the children of the former president, and Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nSeveral former Trump officials and allies have also had their protections revoked, including ex-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, a former national security adviser who had become a vocal critic.\n\nHarris faced several security threats during her time in office, and former Secret Service officials have said that the dangers were compounded by the fact that she was the first woman and first person of colour to serve in the office.\n\nIn August 2024, for example, a Virginia man was charged with making online threats to kill, kidnap or injure Harris and former President Barack Obama.\n\nIn an earlier incident in 2021, a 39-year old Florida woman pled guilty to making threats against Harris after admitting she sent videos to her imprisoned husband in which she displayed weapons and said that a \"hit\" could be carried out within 50 days.\n\nTrump faced two assassination attempts during last year's presidential campaign, during which the Secret Service played a key role in protecting him."

Then she got a call from him inside \"Alligator Alcatraz\". \"We had no idea where he was until he called us,\" Yaneisy told the BBC. \"He said, 'mom, they took me to the facility of the crocodiles.' That's how he put it.\" The temporary immigration detention centre built in Florida's Everglades has quickly become a polarising symbol of President Donald Trump's immigration policy. Now, just two months after it opened, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said it will be shutting it down, in compliance with a judge's orders. The process is already under way - border tsar Tom Homan told the BBC during a press conference that only about 50% of the detainees remain. The BBC spoke to the families of two inmates who were moved in the past month, who say that their loved ones disappeared into the system when they were at their most vulnerable. That includes Yaneisy's son Michael Borrego Fernandez, who says he was left bleeding while in serious pain after a medical incident, before being moved to another facility. He is part of an ongoing lawsuit alleging inmates were denied in-person access to their lawyers. The abandoned Florida airport being turned into Alligator Alcatraz\n\nTrump's 'Alligator Alcatraz' being emptied of immigrant detainees\n\n'The facility of the crocodiles'\n\nBuilt over eight days at the end of June in the Everglades, a protected wetlands famous for its alligators, the South Florida Detention Facility quickly became one of the most notorious immigration detention centres in the US. Dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\", the facility was built to house about 3,000 people but was never at capacity, even as the number of individuals being held in immigration detention across the US reached a record-high of 59,000 as of mid-August. While it was open, it was a lightning rod for America's debate over Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration. Some came to visit the centre to protest, while others stopped by to take proud selfies with the \"Alligator Alcatraz\" sign outside.\n\nSOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images A large Alligator Alcatraz sign was put up outside the camp\n\nWhen the facility first opened, the Florida Republican Party commissioned Alligator Alcatraz merchandise: t-shirts, caps and beer coolers. \"People are fired up about the idea that we are finally closing the border and sending people who are here illegally who are committing crimes out of the country,\" said Florida GOP chair, Evan Power. \"We have laws that you have to follow,\" Jack Lombardi, a Republican voter in Florida, told the BBC. \"And you're a guest in our country. [\u2026] The facts are you came to this country illegally. You came in here unwanted.\" There have been conflicting reports about conditions inside. After a visit by lawmakers in July, Republicans said it was a well-run, safe and clean facility. Democrats, however, described the conditions as vile, crowded and unsanitary. Now, a judge has ordered a preliminary injunction to shut it down within 60 days, while they hear a case claiming the government did not follow protocol when it built the facility. Although the government is appealing against that decision, the DHS said it will obey the judge's order. \"I disagree with the judge that made that decision,\" Homan told media on Thursday. \"I went down there. I walked into detention areas. I saw a clean, well-maintained facility.\"\n\n'They left him there like a dog'\n\nMichael Fernandez moved to the US from Cuba in 2019, and was granted temporary political asylum, his mother said. After he got caught up in a hot-tub construction scheme in 2021, a judge ordered his removal. In June, he pleaded guilty to grand theft to avoid jail time, although he says he had no idea the company he worked for was scamming customers. His lawyer also says that Michael was not aware of the removal order against him. In January, he got pulled over by police while driving his niece to school. By June, he was in the custody of US Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) officers, and moved to the Florida detention centre. Michael had been in \"Alligator Alcatraz\" less than a week when Yaneisy received a call from some of the men detained alongside him. \"They told me that Michael woke up covered in blood,\" she said. Michael had developed stage 4 haemorrhoids - the most severe type - she said. He was transferred to hospital and underwent colon surgery. Back at the facility, Michael spoke to his mother in short, monitored phone calls. \"He couldn't even stay on the phone for more than a few seconds because he was in such severe pain,\" she said. He told her that he had an infection. \"He felt he was going to have a heart attack,\" said Yaneisy. \"And they took him back to hospital.\" Michael told her he was not being given pain medication and one night was handcuffed through the night in a way that he couldn't sleep facedown as required after his surgery. Yaneisy says Michael told her that they didn't let him shower or give him a change of underwear when his briefs were covered in his blood and stool. \"This is not hygienic. They left him there like a dog, like someone who's been thrown away,\" she added.\n\nMiami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images Alligator Alcatraz is being shut down, in compliance with a judge's orders\n\nMichael's case is now part of a lawsuit against the Trump administration, which claims that detainees don't have proper access to legal counsel through confidential in-person meetings with their lawyers. The DHS told the BBC that there is a physical space for lawyers to meet with their clients. The lawsuit is ongoing. He was moved to a different facility on 1 August. The DHS told the BBC in a statement: \"These claims about Michael Borrego Fernandez are FALSE.\" They said that ICE provided him \"with proper medical care and medications\". The Florida Division of Emergency Management said that detainees have access to \"24/7 medical care that includes a pharmacy, as well as clean, working facilities for hygiene and can schedule both in-person and virtual appointments with attorneys\". Mich Gonzalez, Michael's lawyer, says that while immigration detention centers are supposed to be non-punitive - a place to supervise immigrants who are facing deportation - the conditions inside these facilities are \"degrading and deadly\". \"And the Everglades internment camp even more so,\" he said.\n\nA week without news\n\nYaneisy is not the only one who has had a loved one get seriously sick while inside \"Alligator Alcatraz\". When Gladys's husband Marco Alvarez Bravo, 38, was arrested and taken to the detention facility, it was her worst nightmare. Then he disappeared for over a week.\n\nAFP via Getty Images The camp was built on a disused airfield deep in the Florida Everglades and is surrounded by swamps containing alligators and poisonous snakes\n\nIt all began over a month ago when Marco left his home in Tallahassee, Florida, to visit a client to give an estimate for a construction job. Just outside their apartment, ICE agents pulled him over. \"I ask the officers, why are you taking him?\" Gladys recalled. \"He has a legal pending status. [\u2026] He's not a criminal.\" Marco arrived in the US from Chile seven years ago. He entered the country on a tourist visa, which he overstayed, and then applied for political asylum. Gladys, a US citizen who met him through friends around the same time, said this claim is ongoing and he was allowed to stay in the country while waiting for a decision. They got married 11 days before the arrest. In a response to the BBC, the DHS alleged Marco was \"a known member of a South American Theft Group\". Gladys said that her husband has no criminal record. As soon as he was taken away, Gladys was worried for her husband's safety. Marco has a genetic heart condition called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, Gladys said, which causes the heart to beat abnormally fast. He had undergone a medical procedure to treat his illness in April this year, and was taking daily heart medication. Gladys told the BBC that following the procedure he also contracted pneumonia, which he was still suffering from when he was arrested. Initially, Gladys had no idea where he was taken because he didn't show up on the ICE locator database, an official online database that shows where people are being held. Gunther Sanabria, an immigration lawyer who has represented clients inside \"Alligator Alcatraz\", said it has become commonplace for people detained by ICE not to show up in the official locator system. \"We get people here crying every week,\" he said, \"because they don't know where their family members are, and they went to work that morning and they were taken away.\" But Marco's calls from inside the Florida detention centre reassured Gladys.\n\nWatch: \u2018I have grave concerns\u2019 - Advocate weighs environmental impact of \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\"\n\nOn 14 August, he called to tell her that he had a rupture in his kidney which had affected his spine. The next day, another man who was being held alongside Marco called her to say that her husband was in a wheelchair and had been taken to Florida Kendall hospital. That was the last she heard for over a week. She checked daily on the ICE locator, but could not find his name. It took eight days before she knew what had happened. \"I cannot believe that this is actually happening,\" she said. \"Where's my husband?\" The DHS told the BBC that Marco was receiving medical care, but did not respond to a specific question about where he was currently being held. In a statement to the BBC they said: \"He is alert and can at any time call his family.\" Finally, she received a call from Marco on 22 August. He was back in \"Alligator Alcatraz\". But within days they were preparing to move him again. Neither Marco nor Gladys knew where to. \"I'm very nervous, very confused about everything that's going on and my nerves are a total wreck,\" she said. As of this week, Marco appears to have been moved to the Krome detention facility 35 miles way. While the judge's decision to shut down the facility marked a blow to the Trump administration, other temporary facilities are being built in several Republican-led states, including a second facility in Florida dubbed \"Deportation Depot\" and another in Indiana that homeland security officials have named the \"Speedway Slammer\". Looking to the future, Homan said that while \"Alligator Alcatraz\" was a \"great transitional facility\", he did not see it as a long-term solution. \"I do think ICE needs more brick-and-mortar [facilities],\" he told reporters. \"We've got the money now to build infrastructure... permanent facilities.\" With additional reporting by Bernd Debusmann Jr"

They left him there like a dog, like someone who's been thrown away,\" she added.\n\nMiami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images Alligator Alcatraz is being shut down, in compliance with a judge's orders\n\nMichael's case is now part of a lawsuit against the Trump administration, which claims that detainees don't have proper access to legal counsel through confidential in-person meetings with their lawyers. The DHS told the BBC that there is a physical space for lawyers to meet with their clients. The lawsuit is ongoing. He was moved to a different facility on 1 August. The DHS told the BBC in a statement: \"These claims about Michael Borrego Fernandez are FALSE.\" They said that ICE provided him \"with proper medical care and medications\". The Florida Division of Emergency Management said that detainees have access to \"24/7 medical care that includes a pharmacy, as well as clean, working facilities for hygiene and can schedule both in-person and virtual appointments with attorneys\". Mich Gonzalez, Michael's lawyer, says that while immigration detention centers are supposed to be non-punitive - a place to supervise immigrants who are facing deportation - the conditions inside these facilities are \"degrading and deadly\". \"And the Everglades internment camp even more so,\" he said.\n\nA week without news\n\nYaneisy is not the only one who has had a loved one get seriously sick while inside \"Alligator Alcatraz\". When Gladys's husband Marco Alvarez Bravo, 38, was arrested and taken to the detention facility, it was her worst nightmare. Then he disappeared for over a week.\n\nAFP via Getty Images The camp was built on a disused airfield deep in the Florida Everglades and is surrounded by swamps containing alligators and poisonous snakes\n\nIt all began over a month ago when Marco left his home in Tallahassee, Florida, to visit a client to give an estimate for a construction job. Just outside their apartment, ICE agents pulled him over. \"I ask the officers, why are you taking him?\" Gladys recalled. \"He has a legal pending status. [\u2026] He's not a criminal.\" Marco arrived in the US from Chile seven years ago. He entered the country on a tourist visa, which he overstayed, and then applied for political asylum. Gladys, a US citizen who met him through friends around the same time, said this claim is ongoing and he was allowed to stay in the country while waiting for a decision. They got married 11 days before the arrest. In a response to the BBC, the DHS alleged Marco was \"a known member of a South American Theft Group\". Gladys said that her husband has no criminal record. As soon as he was taken away, Gladys was worried for her husband's safety. Marco has a genetic heart condition called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, Gladys said, which causes the heart to beat abnormally fast. He had undergone a medical procedure to treat his illness in April this year, and was taking daily heart medication. Gladys told the BBC that following the procedure he also contracted pneumonia, which he was still suffering from when he was arrested. Initially, Gladys had no idea where he was taken because he didn't show up on the ICE locator database, an official online database that shows where people are being held. Gunther Sanabria, an immigration lawyer who has represented clients inside \"Alligator Alcatraz\", said it has become commonplace for people detained by ICE not to show up in the official locator system. \"We get people here crying every week,\" he said, \"because they don't know where their family members are, and they went to work that morning and they were taken away.\" But Marco's calls from inside the Florida detention centre reassured Gladys.\n\nWatch: \u2018I have grave concerns\u2019 - Advocate weighs environmental impact of \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\"\n\nOn 14 August, he called to tell her that he had a rupture in his kidney which had affected his spine. The next day, another man who was being held alongside Marco called her to say that her husband was in a wheelchair and had been taken to Florida Kendall hospital. That was the last she heard for over a week. She checked daily on the ICE locator, but could not find his name. It took eight days before she knew what had happened. \"I cannot believe that this is actually happening,\" she said. \"Where's my husband?\" The DHS told the BBC that Marco was receiving medical care, but did not respond to a specific question about where he was currently being held. In a statement to the BBC they said: \"He is alert and can at any time call his family.\" Finally, she received a call from Marco on 22 August. He was back in \"Alligator Alcatraz\". But within days they were preparing to move him again. Neither Marco nor Gladys knew where to. \"I'm very nervous, very confused about everything that's going on and my nerves are a total wreck,\" she said. As of this week, Marco appears to have been moved to the Krome detention facility 35 miles way. While the judge's decision to shut down the facility marked a blow to the Trump administration, other temporary facilities are being built in several Republican-led states, including a second facility in Florida dubbed \"Deportation Depot\" and another in Indiana that homeland security officials have named the \"Speedway Slammer\". Looking to the future, Homan said that while \"Alligator Alcatraz\" was a \"great transitional facility\", he did not see it as a long-term solution. \"I do think ICE needs more brick-and-mortar [facilities],\" he told reporters. \"We've got the money now to build infrastructure... permanent facilities.\" With additional reporting by Bernd Debusmann Jr"

    "content": "The trade in US body parts that's completely legal - but ripe for exploitation\n\n2 days ago Share Save Luke Mintz BBC News Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nHarold Dillard was 56 when he was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer around his abdomen in November 2009. Within weeks the former car mechanic and handyman - a Texan \"Mr Fix It\" type who wore a cowboy hat and jeans nearly every day - was in end-of-life hospice care. In his final days, Mr Dillard was visited at the hospice by a company called Bio Care. They asked if he might like to donate his body to medical science, where it could be used by doctors to practise knee replacement surgery. The company would cremate the parts of his body that weren't used and return his ashes free of charge. \"His eyes lit up,\" his daughter, Farrah Fasold, remembers. \"He viewed that as lessening the burden on his family. Donating his body was the last selfless thing he could do.\" Mr Dillard died on Christmas Eve, and within hours, a car from Bio Care pulled up outside the hospice and drove his body away. A few months later, his daughter received a call from the police. They had found her father's head.\n\nHarold Dillard's body was \"mutilated\", his daughter Farrah Fasold says\n\nAt the company's warehouse, police say they found more than 100 body parts belonging to 45 people. \"All of the bodies appeared to have been dismembered by a coarse cutting instrument, such as a chainsaw,\" a detective wrote at the time. Ms Fasold says she imagined her father's body would be handled with respect - but instead it was \"mutilated\", she believes. \"I would close my eyes at night and see huge red tubs filled with body parts. I had insomnia. I wasn't sleeping.\" The company said at the time through a lawyer that they denied mistreating bodies. The firm no longer exists, and its former owners could not be reached for comment. This was Ms Fasold's first introduction to the world of so-called body brokers: private companies that acquire corpses, dissect them, and then sell the limbs for a profit, often to medical research centres. For critics, the industry represents a modern form of grave-robbing. Others argue that body-donation is essential for medical research and that private companies are simply filling a gap left by universities, who consistently fail to acquire enough dead bodies to support their education and research programmes. Although Ms Fasold didn't realise it at the time, her father's case sheds light on an emotion-fuelled debate that cuts to the centre of our ideas about life, and what it means to have a dignified death.\n\nThe body business\n\nSince at least the 19th Century, when the teaching of medicine expanded, some scientifically-minded people have rather liked the idea that their corpse could be used to train doctors. Brandi Schmitt is director of the anatomical donation programme at the University of California, a popular destination for people wishing to bequeath their bodies. She says last year they received 1,600 \"whole-body donations\", and they have a list of almost 50,000 living people who have already registered to do so. Often, body-donation is driven by simple altruism, she says: \"A lot of people are either educated or interested in education.\" But financial factors come into play too. Funerals are expensive, Ms Schmitt says; many are tempted by the prospect of their body being taken away for free.\n\nThe Body Shop Conversations with body brokers, scientists and affected families shed light on this murky industry. Listen on BBC Sounds or on BBC Radio 4 at 13:30 BST on Sunday 31 August. Produced by Jacob Dabb and 2 Degrees West.\n\nLike most medical schools, the University of California does not profit from its body-donation programme, and it has strict guidelines for how corpses - or cadavers, as they are known medically - should be handled. But in recent decades, something more controversial has emerged in the US: a network of for-profit businesses that act as middlemen, acquiring bodies from individuals, dissecting them, and then selling them on. They are widely nicknamed body brokers, though the firms call themselves \"non-transplant tissue banks\". Some of their customers are universities, which use cadavers to train doctors. Others are medical engineering firms, which use limbs to test products like new hip implants. The for-profit body part trade is effectively outlawed in the UK and other European countries, but looser regulation in the US has allowed the trade to flourish. The largest investigation of its kind - conducted by Reuters journalist Brian Grow, in 2017 - identified 25 for-profit body broking companies in the US. One of them earned $12.5m (\u00a39.3m) over three years from the body-part business. Some of those firms are broadly respected, and claim to follow rigorous ethical guidelines. Others have been accused of disrespecting the dead and exploiting vulnerable people in grief.\n\nA global trade\n\nThe trade has grown because of a gap in US regulation, says Jenny Kleeman, who spent years researching the topic for her book, The Price of Life. Whilst the UK's Human Tissue Act makes it illegal in almost all cases to profit from a body part, no comparable law exists in the US. Technically, the US's Uniform Anatomical Gift Act bans the sale of human tissue - but the same law allows you to charge a \"reasonable amount\" for the \"processing\" of a body part. These loose laws have turned the US into a global exporter of cadavers. In her book, Kleeman found that one of the largest US players shipped body parts to more than 50 countries, including the UK. \"In many countries, there is a shortfall of donations,\" Ms Kleeman says. \"And where they can get bodies is from America.\" There is no formal register of brokers, and official statistics are hard to find. But Reuters calculated that, from 2011 to 2015, private brokers in the US received at least 50,000 bodies, and distributed more than 182,000 body parts.\n\n'Bodies of the state'\n\nFor some, private body brokers represent the very worst sort of ambulance-chasing greed. In his Reuters investigation, Mr Grow found cases of brokers becoming \"intertwined with the American funeral industry\" via arrangements in which funeral homes introduce brokers to relatives of the recently-deceased. In return, the home received a referral fee, sometimes exceeding $1,000 (\u00a3750). Horror stories are easy to find - and because of the US's light regulation, there's often no legal recourse when things go wrong. After her run-in with Bio Care, Ms Fasold hoped for a criminal prosecution. As well as the fact that her father's limbs may have been cut with a chainsaw, she was unhappy about a package she had received in the post, in a zip-lock bag, which the company claimed was her father's ashes. She says the contents did not look or feel like human ashes.\n\nHarold Dillard was a classic Texan \"cowboy\", his daughter says. She was told the company that handled her father's remains had not broken any state laws\n\nBio Care's owner was initially charged with fraud, but the charge was later withdrawn because prosecutors could not prove an intent to deceive. Increasingly desperate, Ms Fasold contacted the local district prosecutor. But she was told that Bio Care had not broken any state criminal laws. Equally as controversial are \"bodies of the state\" donations - when a homeless person dies on the street, or somebody dies in hospital without known next-of-kin, and their corpse is donated to science. In theory, county officials first try to find relatives; only if they cannot locate anyone is the body given away. But the BBC has heard that this may not always happen. Last year, Tim Leggett was scrolling a news app at his home in Texas when he found a list of local people whose bodies had been used in this way. He was shocked to see the name of his older brother, Dale, a forklift truck-operator who had died of respiratory failure a year earlier. His brother's body was used by a for-profit medical education company to train anaesthesiologists. It was one of more than 2,000 unclaimed bodies given to the University of North Texas Health Science Center between 2019 and 2024, under agreements with the Dallas and Tarrant counties. \"I was angry,\" Mr Leggett says. \"He would not want to be an object of discussion, or [to have] people pointing at him.\" His brother was a quiet man who mostly \"just wanted to be left alone\", Mr Leggett remembers, and his aversion to technology made it difficult to stay in touch. Still, Mr Leggett says his brother was a human, like anyone else, who deserved dignity in death. \"He liked Marvel comic books; he had a cat that he named Cat,\" he remembers. In a statement to the BBC, the University of North Texas Health Science Center gave its \"deepest apologies\" to the affected families, and said it was \"refocusing\" its programme on education and \"improv[ing] the quality of health for families and future generations\". Since the story first emerged last year, they said, they have fired staff who oversaw the programme.\n\nUnfairly villainised?\n\nBut horror stories like these aside, others point out that body donation plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. Ms Schmitt of the University of California says that at the most basic level, bodies are used to teach doctors, or for surgeons to practise complicated operations. Often, it's the first time a medical student works with real flesh and blood - an experience that can't be replicated from a textbook. \"Those students will go on to help people,\" she says. Then there are the cadavers used to help engineer new treatments. Ms Schmitt points to a number of technologies that were only developed, she says, after being tested on bodies. These include knee and hip replacements, robotic surgery, and pacemakers.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images For many medical students, practising on a dead body is the first time they work with real flesh and blood\n\nAnd some of the private brokers say they are being unfairly villainised. Kevin Lowbrera, who works for one of the big \"body broking\" companies, says its accreditation by the American Association of Tissue Banks means it has to follow guidelines determining how cadavers are treated and stored. Accreditation is voluntary - seven companies have signed up - and a private broker doesn't need it to operate legally. The problem is not with honest companies like his, Mr Lowbrera says - it is with the rogue players. \"There are still programmes out there that are not accredited. I tell people all the time, stay away from them,\" he says. It would be wrong to regulate his whole industry out of existence, he says, because of some bad apples.\n\nBeyond the for-profit trade?\n\nVirtually everyone I speak to - on all sides of the debate - thinks that more regulation in the US is needed. So, what could that look like? Ms Schmitt, of the University of California, suggests the US could perhaps follow European countries and ban for-profit body broking. She says there are some \"legitimate costs\" that come with processing a body - like spending on transport, and preservative chemicals. It's reasonable for companies to charge for these, she says. But the idea of actually making a profit makes many feel squeamish. \"The ability to sell or profit from human remains I think complicates the altruistic idea of donating for education,\" she says. She suggests the US could emulate its own policy on organ donation - which is governed by the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, and prohibits the sale of organs. But the author Ms Kleeman says that if the US banned for-profit body donation tomorrow, there simply wouldn't be enough cadavers to go around. \"If you don't want there to be a trade in these body parts, we need to get a way of more people donating altruistically,\" she says.\n\nShe urges universities to launch more robust promotional campaigns, asking directly for body donations. \"There isn't the same public awareness campaign as there is for organ donation, for example.\" Once this shortage is addressed, she says, then the US could ban for-profit donation. It's also possible that advances in virtual reality (VR) technology mean that cadavers simply won't be needed in the future. A trainee doctor could simply put on a headset and practice on a computer-generated patient. In 2023, Case Western Reserve University became one of the first medical schools in the United States to remove human bodies from its training programme, and replace them with VR models. Real human bodies preserve the \"body's colours and textures, [which] can make it difficult to discern, say, a nerve from a blood vessel\", Mark Griswold, a professor at the school, told the website Lifewire at the time. In contrast, their computer programme \"gives students a crystal clear 3D map of these anatomical structures and their relationships to each other\", he said. But Ms Kleeman says that, in general, VR technology is not yet good enough to replicate practicing on a cadaver. For the time being, it seems, there will remain a demand for human bodies - as well as money to be made. Additional reporting: Jacob Dabb"

    "content": "How US shoppers will be hit as 'de minimis' tariff exemption ends\n\n4 days ago Share Save Osmond Chia & Laura Blasey Reporters in Singapore & Washington DC Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe US has pulled the plug on a long-running global tariff exemption that has been widely used by buyers of low-cost goods. From Friday, imports valued at $800 (\u00a3592) or less will no longer be duty-free and will face tighter customs checks, in a move set to affect millions of shipments a day. Last year, almost 1.4 billion packages - worth a total of more than $64bn - entered America without being charged duties under a rule called the de minimis exemption, according to US Customs. Experts say US President Donald Trump's policy change will hit small businesses hardest and shoppers should brace for higher prices and fewer options - at least until the dust settles. \"I've reached the point of acceptance, but when I first heard the news about two and half, three weeks ago, I felt like it might be the end for my business,\" said Katherine Theobalds, founder and creative director of Buenos Aires-based shoe brand Zou Xou. \"It still might - that remains to be seen.\"\n\nWhat's the de minimis rule?\n\nDe minimis is a Latin term that broadly translates to \"about the smallest things\", often used in legal contexts to describe matters too trivial to merit concern. The de minimis exemption was introduced in 1938 to avoid the expense of collecting only small amounts of import duties in the US. The rule's threshold rose over the years, allowing e-commerce firms and global retailers that ship small packages to the US to thrive. The exemption was often associated with companies like Chinese e-commerce giants Shein and Temu, which delivered Americans cheap goods that could be quickly shipped from the manufacturing source - with no warehouse stock or associated overhead costs. But while Shein and Temu helped pioneer this way of working, many other businesses - foreign and domestic, large and small - came to incorporate the \"loophole\" into their supply chains and sales models. Executives at Tapestry - the parent company of US fashion brand Coach, which is known for leather bags that sell from roughly $200 to $1,000 - told analysts this month that it expects to take a $160m hit to its profits due to changing tariff policies, with about a third of that attributed to the elimination of the de minimis rule. Coach has rapidly expanded in recent years in a comeback campaign fuelled by Gen Z shoppers and Tapestry remains confident the momentum will offset some of the impact of tariffs. Still, the elimination of de minimis represents a logistical challenge. Shipments under the exemption made up more than 90% of all the cargo entering the country, according to US customs. The president and his predecessor, Joe Biden, criticised the policy as harmful to US businesses and said it has been abused to smuggle illegal goods, including drugs like fentanyl. In a phone call with reporters on Thursday, Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said the move will \"save thousands of American lives by restricting the flow of narcotics\" through the mail, as well as add $10bn a year to US coffers.\n\nReuters Firms like Shein used the exemption to ship low-cost items\n\nTrump fast-tracked the rule's repeal with an executive order this year, well ahead of a planned 2027 expiry date. With the necessary documentation, shippers will pay duties based on the country of origin's tariff rate. Otherwise, they can choose to pay a fixed fee between $80 and $200 per package, according to the White House. The second option, which is aimed to give postal services more time to adjust to the change, will only be available for six months. Mainland China and Hong Kong were the first to be cut from the de minimis rule in May, prompting e-commerce giant Temu to halt direct sales to the US. Letters and personal gifts worth less than $100 will still be duty-free.\n\nSmaller variety, longer waits\n\nUS consumers may see less variety of goods in shops and on e-commerce platforms as businesses get to grips with customs documentation, trade experts have told the BBC. Smaller firms need time to adjust as they have mostly been spared from such paperwork until now, said Tam Nguyen from logistics administration firm GOL Solution. The company handles exports from South East Asia to the US. \"You need to indicate the source of all the materials in a product, which can come from many countries with different tax rates. This would absolutely make shipments slower.\" The complexity could deter sellers from offering a broader range of products for export, she added. That could have a particular impact on more niche markets. Christopher Lundell, is a 53-year-old psychologist based in Portland, Oregon who also DJs and mixes music as a hobby. He is an avid vinyl record collector who recently became aware of the de minimis exemption suspension when he tried to - unsuccessfully - buy a $5 rare record from a seller in the UK. \"He cancelled my order and said, 'I'm sorry but the UK is not shipping to the United States anymore.'\" Mr Lundell says he tries his best to find US-based record sellers before searching online for overseas sellers based in countries like the UK, Japan and China. He adds that he understands the need to protect US businesses, but says that he believes a blanket suspension of the de minimis exemption is \"political theatre\". Some orders may also be frozen for the next few weeks. Ms Nguyen said clients, including some in the healthcare sector, have halted orders. Major postal services in the UK, Europe and and the Asia-Pacific region paused deliveries to the US this week. The operators blamed uncertainty about how the tariffs would work and a lack of time to prepare.\n\nPrices to rise\n\nWithout the exemption, businesses will have to factor in tariffs the US has imposed on the country of origin, which came into effect for most nations in August. Those levies can be as low as 10% for countries like the UK and Australia, while goods from Brazil and India face the highest tariffs at 50%. Following the change, specific duties will be imposed of $80 per item for countries with tariffs of 16% or less, $160 for shipments from countries with between 16% and 25% tariffs or $200 for items from countries with higher tariffs. A senior administration official downplayed consumer concerns, saying that the move will \"benefit\" Americans by making them \"safer\" and \"prosperous\". Some American businesses welcomed the news, arguing the elimination would level the playing field. \"Gap Inc. welcomes the Administration's decision to suspend duty-free de minimis treatment worldwide. The de minimis loophole has long provided an opportunity for some importers & retailers to avoid paying their fair share of US duties,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nSmall firms, in particular, will feel the strain from the costly audits needed to clear US customs, making it tough for sellers to keep prices stable, said trade expert Deborah Elms. With many postal services holding off on US shipments, sellers may have to pay for more expensive express couriers to reach American buyers for now, said Ms Elms from research firm Hinrich Foundation. British retailer Wool Warehouse is among firms that have paused orders from the US. \"There is a lot of uncertainty at the moment\" due to the short time firms have had to figure out shipment process and fees involved, said managing director Andrew Smith. His firm hopes to resume orders to the US \u2013 its largest export market \u2013 within two weeks, he said, adding that time is needed to wait to see how other companies have responded to the changes. Prices of its goods \u2013 mostly wool and crafting materials sourced globally - are likely to rise by up to 50%, said Mr Smith. The company also plans to revamp its website to indicate the tariff rate chargeable for each product, he said. \"We're aiming for full transparency so people know what it will cost with certainty and then they can decide whether they want to make the purchase or not.\" At Zou Xou, Ms Theobalds specialises in artisan-made women's shoes, crafted by small workshops in Argentina, that sell for between $200-$300. She began her career in New York, and has focussed her business on American customers. She has long operated a two-tier system - customers either receive shoes from a US warehouse where she keeps some stock, or shipped direct from Argentina through DHL.\n\nA boost for China?\n\nLarger shipments of shoes into the US were already subject to customs fees, she says, but sending one or two pairs from Buenos Aires to a customer was achieved cheaply and efficiently because of the de minimis exemption. Now, she's not sure how to factor in the added costs and is exploring several options and hoping to get more clarity on how to shift her business model. Equally important, she said, is how businesses like hers explain the changes to consumers. She worries that even if pricing doesn't change much, a duty process that seems too complicated could turn off even those who want a higher-end product. \"The reason our customers come to us is because they appreciate the artisanal quality. They could have always gone to a mass retailer,\" she says. \"But what people will have to think about is 'does that matter to me all that much, or do I just want a pair of shoes?'\"\n\nAFP via Getty Images Closing the de minimis loophole has made shipping more complicated\n\nUS-based retailers stand to gain if prices of goods ordered from overseas rise, Ms Elms said. \"If it's too expensive, they'll probably go to Walmart or Target to buy it there,\" she said. But with so many goods being sent from around world now being subject to customs duties, US consumers may once again turn to China for cheaper options. Chinese companies like Shein and Temu have set up distribution centres in the US that will help ease some of the cost of tariffs, said Ms Nguyen. And China is \"months ahead\" in figuring out the paperwork as compared to firms in other countries that are now scrambling to get up to speed, she added. There may be fewer competitors in the overall market, as the end of the de minimis exemption makes it harder for small businesses to launch e-commerce sites, said Ms Nguyen. \"It used to be: Set up a site, list products and start shipping. But now that low-cost entry point is gone.\""

Still, the elimination of de minimis represents a logistical challenge. Shipments under the exemption made up more than 90% of all the cargo entering the country, according to US customs. The president and his predecessor, Joe Biden, criticised the policy as harmful to US businesses and said it has been abused to smuggle illegal goods, including drugs like fentanyl. In a phone call with reporters on Thursday, Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said the move will \"save thousands of American lives by restricting the flow of narcotics\" through the mail, as well as add $10bn a year to US coffers.\n\nReuters Firms like Shein used the exemption to ship low-cost items\n\nTrump fast-tracked the rule's repeal with an executive order this year, well ahead of a planned 2027 expiry date. With the necessary documentation, shippers will pay duties based on the country of origin's tariff rate. Otherwise, they can choose to pay a fixed fee between $80 and $200 per package, according to the White House. The second option, which is aimed to give postal services more time to adjust to the change, will only be available for six months. Mainland China and Hong Kong were the first to be cut from the de minimis rule in May, prompting e-commerce giant Temu to halt direct sales to the US. Letters and personal gifts worth less than $100 will still be duty-free.\n\nSmaller variety, longer waits\n\nUS consumers may see less variety of goods in shops and on e-commerce platforms as businesses get to grips with customs documentation, trade experts have told the BBC. Smaller firms need time to adjust as they have mostly been spared from such paperwork until now, said Tam Nguyen from logistics administration firm GOL Solution. The company handles exports from South East Asia to the US. \"You need to indicate the source of all the materials in a product, which can come from many countries with different tax rates. This would absolutely make shipments slower.\" The complexity could deter sellers from offering a broader range of products for export, she added. That could have a particular impact on more niche markets. Christopher Lundell, is a 53-year-old psychologist based in Portland, Oregon who also DJs and mixes music as a hobby. He is an avid vinyl record collector who recently became aware of the de minimis exemption suspension when he tried to - unsuccessfully - buy a $5 rare record from a seller in the UK. \"He cancelled my order and said, 'I'm sorry but the UK is not shipping to the United States anymore.'\" Mr Lundell says he tries his best to find US-based record sellers before searching online for overseas sellers based in countries like the UK, Japan and China. He adds that he understands the need to protect US businesses, but says that he believes a blanket suspension of the de minimis exemption is \"political theatre\". Some orders may also be frozen for the next few weeks. Ms Nguyen said clients, including some in the healthcare sector, have halted orders.

Following the change, specific duties will be imposed of $80 per item for countries with tariffs of 16% or less, $160 for shipments from countries with between 16% and 25% tariffs or $200 for items from countries with higher tariffs. A senior administration official downplayed consumer concerns, saying that the move will \"benefit\" Americans by making them \"safer\" and \"prosperous\". Some American businesses welcomed the news, arguing the elimination would level the playing field. \"Gap Inc. welcomes the Administration's decision to suspend duty-free de minimis treatment worldwide.

    "content": "How US shoppers will be hit as 'de minimis' tariff exemption ends\n\n4 days ago Share Save Osmond Chia & Laura Blasey Reporters in Singapore & Washington DC Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe US has pulled the plug on a long-running global tariff exemption that has been widely used by buyers of low-cost goods. From Friday, imports valued at $800 (\u00a3592) or less will no longer be duty-free and will face tighter customs checks, in a move set to affect millions of shipments a day. Last year, almost 1.4 billion packages - worth a total of more than $64bn - entered America without being charged duties under a rule called the de minimis exemption, according to US Customs. Experts say US President Donald Trump's policy change will hit small businesses hardest and shoppers should brace for higher prices and fewer options - at least until the dust settles. \"I've reached the point of acceptance, but when I first heard the news about two and half, three weeks ago, I felt like it might be the end for my business,\" said Katherine Theobalds, founder and creative director of Buenos Aires-based shoe brand Zou Xou. \"It still might - that remains to be seen.\"\n\nWhat's the de minimis rule?\n\nDe minimis is a Latin term that broadly translates to \"about the smallest things\", often used in legal contexts to describe matters too trivial to merit concern. The de minimis exemption was introduced in 1938 to avoid the expense of collecting only small amounts of import duties in the US. The rule's threshold rose over the years, allowing e-commerce firms and global retailers that ship small packages to the US to thrive. The exemption was often associated with companies like Chinese e-commerce giants Shein and Temu, which delivered Americans cheap goods that could be quickly shipped from the manufacturing source - with no warehouse stock or associated overhead costs. But while Shein and Temu helped pioneer this way of working, many other businesses - foreign and domestic, large and small - came to incorporate the \"loophole\" into their supply chains and sales models. Executives at Tapestry - the parent company of US fashion brand Coach, which is known for leather bags that sell from roughly $200 to $1,000 - told analysts this month that it expects to take a $160m hit to its profits due to changing tariff policies, with about a third of that attributed to the elimination of the de minimis rule.

    "content": "Why has Kamala Harris' security detail been withdrawn?\n\n3 days ago Share Save Bernd Debusmann Jr BBC News, the White House Share Save\n\nGetty Images Unlike former presidents, vice-presidents are not guaranteed protection for the rest of their lives.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has cancelled former Vice-President Kamala Harris' Secret Service detail, seven months after she left office following her unsuccessful presidential campaign. By law, the US Secret Service provides former vice-presidents and their families six months of protection after their terms end. That term, however, can be extended, which former President Joe Biden reportedly did before leaving office. The move already has caused controversy, with both California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass calling it politically motivated. Here's what we know.\n\nWhy did Biden extend her security?\n\nSo far, neither Biden nor Harris have commented on the reasons for extending her security past the mandated six months. CNN reported that Biden extended it for one year with a previously undisclosed directive before leaving office. From a legal perspective, Biden was within his rights to do so. According to a law enacted in 2008, the Secret Service can provide protection to former vice-presidents, their spouses and any children under the age of 16 after leaving office. While the law states that the protection should not extend any more than six months, the secretary of homeland security has the authority to order \"temporary protection\" in situations where \"information or conditions warrant such protection.\" Ronald Kessler, an author with expertise on the Secret Service, told the BBC that \"if you set aside political implications, it's just standard practice.\"\n\nDoes Harris face enhanced risks?\n\nSources familiar with the current situation have told CBS, the BBC's US news partner, that a recent threat assessment did not uncover anything alarming to warrant extending Harris' security arrangements. But some in Harris' team reportedly worried that as the first woman and person of colour to serve as vice-president and as a candidate in a contentious, emotionally charged election, she faced additional threats. A number of threats against Harris were made public during her time in office and as a presidential candidate in 2024. Several men were arrested and charged with making online threats against her in 2024, for example, and in 2021, a Florida woman pleaded guilty to making threats against Harris and admitted she sent videos to her imprisoned husband in which she displayed firearms and said that a \"hit\" could be carried out within 50 days. In March, after Harris left office, a Florida man also was arrested after allegedly threatening to kill her with a sniper rifle. Mr Kessler, however, said that compared to other politicians Harris \"hasn't stirred up that much as far as I can tell.\" \"I think it's a sound judgement on the part of the Secret Service,\" he added. The removal of Harris' detail comes just weeks before she is scheduled to begin a multi-city tour to promote her book, 107 Days, focused on her short-lived, unsuccessful presidential bid. According to Mr Kessler, such an operation would further stretch an already overburdened and undermanned Secret Service. In September, the agency also is responsible for international dignitaries and VIPs at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. \"That would require maybe a dozen Secret Service vehicles all over the country to follow on her big tour,\" he added. \"That's a big drain on the service.\"\n\nWhat elements of security are being taken away?\n\nSecret Service protection extends far beyond the agents that drive a protectee, and protect them and their immediate family. Additionally, the Secret Service is tasked with securing homes, such as Harris' Los Angeles residence, including installation of security systems and alarms. Agents pre-emptively identify and monitor potential threats, including those sent electronically or via social media. It is unclear how much those protections cost, and the Secret Service has not published that figure. Private security for well-known celebrities, VIPs and business leaders can easily reach millions of dollars per year, depending on the level of threats and protection required. Meta, for example, reportedly paid over $23m (\u00a317m) for Mark Zuckerberg's personal security in 2023, including $9.4m in direct security costs.\n\nIs this political retribution from Trump?\n\nAfter the removal of Harris' detail was announced, some of her allies and Trump's political detractors immediately characterised the move as politically motivated by the president. Trump already removed Secret Service protection for former allies and foes alike, including Hunter and Ashley Biden, children of the former president; and Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Several former Trump officials and allies also had their protections revoked, including ex-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, a former national security adviser who had become a vocal critic. \"The safety of our public officials should never be subject to erratic, vindictive political impulses,\" Bob Salladay, spokesman for California Governor Gavin Newsom, told CNN. Mr Kessler said that the \"severely undermanned\" Secret Service likely is refocusing its efforts on more immediate threats, such as those faced by Trump and members of his administration. \"President Trump may have been gleeful to do this,\" he said. \"But there are real sound practical reasons\". Only one other former vice-president, Dick Cheney, is believed to have Secret Service protections extended after leaving office, by then-President Barack Obama.\n\nAre the rules different for former presidents?"

This political arms race for power may seem both bizarre and confusing \u2013 but it is one that is rapidly spreading to other states in advance of next year's national midterm elections. Here's what you should know about America's fight over congressional redistricting.\n\nThe battle began in Texas this summer, when the Republican-majority legislature took the unusual step of re-drawing congressional seats in the middle of the decade - in a deliberate effort to send more Republicans to the House of Representatives in Washington. The Lone Star State's goal was to add five additional congressional seats, which would favour Republicans. California responded by re-drawing its own districts to boost Democratic representation by five seats, in an attempt to cancel out the move by Texas. Missouri is the third state to join the fight, which comes after President Donald Trump called on loyal statehouses across the country to carve up their districts in order to maintain full Republican control of Congress after the November election.\n\nWhat is redistricting?\n\nThe US House of Representatives is made up of 435 legislators who are elected every two years. They represent districts with boundaries determined in processes set by their state governments. Some states have non-partisan independent commissions which determine districts, while others leave it up to the state legislature. Who draws the lines and how can go a long way in shaping the ideological tilt of the district and the likelihood that it elects a Democrat or a Republican. At the moment, the House rests on a knife's edge, with Democrats only needing to seize three more seats to flip the chamber in their balance. The president's party historically loses seats in the midterm election after their victory. If Democrats seize the House, they can launch sweeping investigations of presidential actions, as Democrats did in the second half of Trump's first term and Republicans did in Joe Biden's final two years.\n\nGetty Images\n\nWhy is everyone talking about redistricting now?\n\nEach member of the US House represents a district in their home state. The districts are typically set after the US Census is conducted every decade to account for the states' population changes. But Republicans and Democrats are now fighting to redraw the maps mid-decade, either to help or block Trump's agenda. By changing the make-ups of the districts, each party hopes to capture more seats in the House. Trump has called on Republican-controlled statehouses across the country to re-draw their districts to try to prevent his party from losing control of the House in the November midterm elections. But the effort in Texas hit a roadblock in early August after the state's Democrats fled the state in a bid to deny the quorum needed to pass the Republican redistricting measure. They returned after two weeks, when the governor ordered them to be arrested. After they returned, the chamber voted 88-52 to create five new seats. The measure was swiftly endorsed by the Senate and then signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott. Democrats and civil rights groups have said Texas' new maps will dilute voting power from minorities, in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act, and have threatened to sue.\n\nWatch: What is gerrymandering? We use gummy bears to explain\n\nHow does redistricting work and is it legal?\n\nGerrymandering - the redrawing of electoral boundaries to favour a political party - is practised by both main parties and is legal unless ruled to be racially motivated. However, it is extremely unusual for the president to publicly back a state's effort to create partisan advantage. While both Democratic and Republican-dominated states have faced criticism and court battles over their US House maps, rarely do lawmakers so explicitly acknowledge the partisan intention behind their actions. Critics argue that the process allows politicians to pick their voters, rather than voters picking their elected officials. It can lead to some very wonky-shaped maps, in which certain groups are lumped together regardless of their geographic proximity. In 2019, the Supreme Court took away the power of the courts to block political gerrymandering. \"Federal judges have no license to reallocate political power between the two major political parties,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his ruling at the time.\n\nCalifornia vs Texas\n\nRedistricting could have significant implications in the 2026 midterms, and has become an urgent issue for state lawmakers. Illinois, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Maryland are among the Democratic-led states prepared to launch countermeasures to the Texas plan. Indiana, Florida, and Ohio are also now looking into redistricting in order to boost Republican representation in Washington. Missouri will hold a special session staring on 3 September to redraw maps, which target a Kansas City-area district held by a Democratic representative. Missouri Governor Mike Kehoe said the new map will \"ensure our districts and Constitution truly put Missouri values first\". California Governor Gavin Newsom, whose state is leading the Democratic charge, has pledged to \"fight fire with fire\" by replicating trying to boost his party's chances of victory. But the process in California is slow, due to a 2008 law designed to make the process less partisan. On 21 August, the California statehouse voted to have the new maps put on the special election ballot in November, to let voters decide if they should shift. The vote may prove controversial, as voters had previously approved a process that leaves it up to a non-partisan commission to decide how voting lines should be drawn. Utah, with four districts all held by Republicans, has been ordered by a judge to redraw its maps ahead of the midterms. The Utah judge ruled that lawmakers had disregarded a rule passed by voters that bans politicians \"from favoring or disfavoring incumbent elected officials or from considering partisan political information\" when drawing their maps. The move is expected to end up favouring Democrats in Salt Lake City, the capitol of the Beehive State. New York wants to enter the fray, but there the process takes even longer, as the state constitution would need to be changed. \"In New York, we'll confront Trump's legal insurrection head-on,\" New York Governor Kathy Hochul pledged. \"We'll meet him on the same field and beat him at his own game.\""

It is a striking symbol of President Trump's efforts to tackle a \"crime emergency\" in the US capital, which has seen his administration take over its police department and send National Guard troops, FBI and ICE agents on to the streets. Trump says his crime crackdown, which began on 11 August, has had an immediate effect: \"The numbers are down like we wouldn't believe, but we believe it\". And he has claimed that it has led to an extended period of time without any murders, a trend he says has not been seen in the US city in decades. So what do the crime figures show?\n\nViolent crime has fallen\n\nThere has been a significant fall in overall violent crime since the crackdown started, according to Washington's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). It recorded 75 violent crimes from 12-26 August, a drop of 23% on the previous two weeks. Property crimes, such as burglary and vehicle theft, fell by about a quarter over the same period. There was a smaller fall in the crime of \"assault with a dangerous weapon\" and an increase in recorded \"sex abuse\".\n\nUS crime analyst Jeff Asher says this may not reveal the whole picture though. \"Reporting [of crime] always lags so some of that decline is likely artificial. You probably need six weeks or so for incident-based reporting to catch up and make a comparison of the most recent period.\" MPD figures also show violent crime has fallen in the city over the past fortnight when compared to the same period last year.

Criminologists caution against citing arrest figures as a successful measure of tackling crime. They stress that even if an arrest does lead to a charge, prosecutions can fall apart or the defendant can be found not guilty.\n\nPressure on the court system\n\nThe impact of the arrests and charges was evident when BBC Verify visited DC's District Court on Tuesday. Some defendants have found themselves arrested over crimes which would normally be dealt with by a lower court but are now facing federal offences, which generally result in longer jail time.

The number of suspects being dealt with for a new offence has more than doubled in the two weeks after the crackdown - from 22 initial appearances to 49 - according to figures from the DC District Court.

Court documents seen by BBC Verify show the FBI and other federal agents were involved in the arrest, in which a Mac 9 machine gun was allegedly found. Judge Faruqui said he was concerned that the defendant was now on \"suicide watch\" and had not yet had the opportunity to enter a plea.

The Pentagon has sent 20 military lawyers from its Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps to the US Attorney's Office for DC to help with prosecutions.

Some people also try to go through the Sahara, which comprises 90% of Mauritanian territory, braving temperatures above 45C.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has reported abuses of migrants by Mauritanian security officials.\n\nIn a 142-page report released on Wednesday, HRW said it had documented \u201cpolice use of prolonged, painful restraints, limited food and water, and other mistreatment\u201d in a crackdown funded since 2024 by a \u20ac210m (\u00a3182m) deal with the EU.\n\nAuthorities in Nouakchott have not yet responded to the report, which has caused debate in government and humanitarian circles this week."

To save our patients, we had to run up and down and borrow from other facilities to ensure we have something to give to our patients.\n\n\u201cWe have scaled down on the dose ration given to the patients,\u201d he said.\n\nGama said the district has also run out of the cartridges used for diagnosis of TB samples and that they had been forced to stop all testing.\n\nThe TB officer for the neighbouring district of Rumphi, Umar Mwamadi, estimated that the district had enough stocks of drugs to last another month.\n\n\u201cWe are not yet affected by the stock out, but we are also at a greater risk because our drug can only take us up to mid or late September,\u201d he said.\n\nWongani Nyirenda, a hospital official in Machinga district, said stocks were also low there.\n\n\u201cThe situation is manageable because we can mobilise drugs from one facility or district which has [stocks] to another, which is in need, to save lives. But the problem may get worse in the next few weeks when all facilities will be [without supplies],\u201d said Nyirenda.\n\nA Malawi health rights activist, Maziko Matemba, called on the government to intervene to avoid chaos as more facilities across the country struggled to find supplies.\n\n\u201cIt is high time African countries should start manufacturing some of these drugs,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the decline in cases, TB remains a public health concern in Malawi and has been hit badly by the drop in international funding, with an estimated incidence rate of 119 per 100 000 people (compared with eight per 100,000 in the UK) and a mortality rate of 38.6 per 100,000. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 47% of TB cases in Malawi are co-infected with HIV.\n\nMalawi is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, with 70% of its 21.66 million people living in extreme poverty, on less than $2.15 a day, and 51% of the population eating less than the minimum daily calorie intake."

    "content": "An attempt to promote friendship between Japan and countries in Africa has transformed into a xenophobic row about migration after inaccurate media reports suggested the scheme would lead to a \u201cflood of immigrants\u201d.\n\nThe controversy erupted after the Japan International Cooperation Agency, or JICA, said this month it had designated four Japanese cities as \u201cAfrica hometowns\u201d for partner countries in Africa: Mozambique, Nigeria, Ghana and Tanzania.\n\nThe programme, announced at the end of an international conference on African development in Yokohama, will involve personnel exchanges and events to foster closer ties between the four regional Japanese cities \u2013 Imabari, Kisarazu, Sanjo and Nagai \u2013 and the African nations.\n\nMedia coverage in the four countries, and Japanese-language references to the articles, have been blamed for triggering an ugly backlash on social media in Japan, along with a wave of angry calls and emails to the Japanese cities\u2019 offices.\n\nSome critics appeared to believe that \u201chometown\u201d status meant that people from the African countries would be given special permission to live and work in their Japanese partner cities.\n\n\u201cIf immigrants come flooding in, who is going to take responsibility?\u201d said one social media post.\n\nOne post on X claiming that Kisarazu was \u201cseriously considering handing over the city to Africans\u201d attracted 4.6m views.\n\nThe four cities have received thousands of complaints from confused residents. \u201cOur team of 15 officials spent a whole day handling hundreds of phone calls and thousands of emails from residents,\u201d an official in Sanjo told Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe town has received 350 phone calls and 3,500 emails since Monday, the official said, while Imabari has fielded 460 calls and 1,400 emails from residents asking if the town had adopted a new immigration policy.\n\nJapan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi, said the claims were baseless. \u201cThere are no plans to promote accepting immigrants or issue special visas,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe cities also attempted to set the record straight. The mayor of Kisarazu, Yoshikuni Watanabe, pointed out that the city had hosted Nigerian athletes during the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, adding that project would not lead to \u201caccepting migrants\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cOur initiatives will involve cooperating in the education of young people based on discipline through baseball and softball, and it\u2019s not a programme that will lead to relocation or immigration.\u201d\n\nThe mayor of Sanjo, Ryo Takizawa, said in a statement: \u201cIt is not true that the city has requested to accept migrants or immigrants from Ghana, and the city has no plans to make such a request in the future.\u201d\n\nSome attributed the outcry to an article in the Tanzania Times that carried the headline \u201cJapan dedicates Nagai city to Tanzania.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cdedicates\u201d was translated on social media into the Japanese word sasageru, which could be interpreted to mean the town was being \u201csacrificed\u201d to Tanzania, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.\n\nNigeria\u2019s government also appeared to have misunderstood the details of the programme, describing Kisarazu as a location open to \u201cNigerians willing to live and work [in Japan]\u201d. Japan\u2019s government, it added, would create a special visa category for skilled people from the West African country.\n\nJapan\u2019s foreign ministry has reportedly asked the Nigerian government to issue a correction, while JICA \u2013 a government agency \u2013 said several media organisations had published articles containing \u201cinaccuracies and potentially misleading information\u201d.\n\n\u201cJICA is currently urging the relevant local media and the African government [sic] to promptly correct the inaccuracies contained in their coverage,\u201d it said on its website."

    "content": "In 2010, Gerardo Ceballos and a group of other researchers set out to answer a burning question: how many jaguars were there in Mexico? They knew there weren\u2019t many. Hunting, loss of habitat, conflict with cattle ranchers and other issues had pushed the population to the brink of extinction.\n\nCeballos and his team from the National Alliance for Jaguar Conservation (ANCJ) thought there were maybe 1,000 jaguars across the country. They decided to carry out the country\u2019s first census of the animal to find out exactly how many there were. They found 4,100.\n\n\u201cIt was a great surprise, terrific news,\u201d Ceballos said. \u201cObviously 4,000 means the species is still in danger of extinction, but 4,000 is a lot better than 1,000.\u201d\n\nFast-forward 15 years and the news has got even better. The group\u2019s latest census found that in 2024 there were 5,326 jaguars in Mexico, a 30% increase compared with 2010.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the country has managed to maintain and increase its population over the last 14 years is extraordinary,\u201d Ceballos said. \u201cFor me it\u2019s great news for the country. Mexico and the world need good news.\u201d\n\nThe census took place over 90 days across 15 states, using 920 motion-capture cameras and involving nearly 50 researchers as well as local community leaders. Researchers looked at an area of 414,000 hectares, making it the largest census for any mammal in Mexico.\n\nJaguars were found across the country, with the largest number in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula region (1,699), followed by the south Pacific area (1,541), north-east and central Mexico (813), the north Pacific (733) and the central Pacific coast (540).\n\nView image in fullscreen A jaguar in the jungle of southern Mexico. Photograph: Mardoz/Alamy\n\nCeballos credits three main factors for the population increase: maintaining natural protected areas where jaguars can roam freely, reducing the conflict between cattle ranchers and jaguars, and a publicity campaign that has put the jaguar on the map.\n\n\u201cBefore when we started, the jaguar was virtually unknown,\u201d Ceballos said. \u201cRight now it\u2019s one of the most well-known species\u201d in Mexico.\n\nStill, at the current rate of population increase it would take 25 to 30 years for the jaguar to no longer be considered at risk of extinction in Mexico. Ceballos and his team aim to reduce that time to just 15 years.\n\nThere are many challenges in their way. Deforestation and loss of habitat continue to be a major issue: Mexico has lost 600,000 hectares of forest and jungle in the last six years. In the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula alone, the country loses 60,000 hectares of forest and jungle each year, vastly reducing the areas in which the jaguar can live and hunt.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

He hopes to work with social media companies to have pages marketing such products taken down.\n\nThe construction of new highways is a continuing challenge. Not only do they fragment a jaguar\u2019s territory but they increase the risk of the animals being run over. This can be mitigated by building specific points where animals such as jaguars can cross safely.\n\nThere is continuing conflict with cattle ranchers, and the spread of diseases from domesticated animals also poses a threat to the jaguar population.\n\nCeballos said a greater financial commitment to conservation from the federal government was needed, as well as support from the private sector, from scientists and from landowners to protect areas where jaguars may be living, if they were to meet their goal.\n\n\u201cWe are winning a battle in a war that is being lost. But it is a very important battle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives us hope that if we articulate the right policies, we can achieve great results.\u201d"

They found 4,100.\n\n\u201cIt was a great surprise, terrific news,\u201d Ceballos said. \u201cObviously 4,000 means the species is still in danger of extinction, but 4,000 is a lot better than 1,000.\u201d\n\nFast-forward 15 years and the news has got even better. The group\u2019s latest census found that in 2024 there were 5,326 jaguars in Mexico, a 30% increase compared with 2010.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the country has managed to maintain and increase its population over the last 14 years is extraordinary,\u201d Ceballos said. \u201cFor me it\u2019s great news for the country. Mexico and the world need good news.\u201d\n\nThe census took place over 90 days across 15 states, using 920 motion-capture cameras and involving nearly 50 researchers as well as local community leaders. Researchers looked at an area of 414,000 hectares, making it the largest census for any mammal in Mexico.\n\nJaguars were found across the country, with the largest number in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula region (1,699), followed by the south Pacific area (1,541), north-east and central Mexico (813), the north Pacific (733) and the central Pacific coast (540).\n\nView image in fullscreen A jaguar in the jungle of southern Mexico. Photograph: Mardoz/Alamy\n\nCeballos credits three main factors for the population increase: maintaining natural protected areas where jaguars can roam freely, reducing the conflict between cattle ranchers and jaguars, and a publicity campaign that has put the jaguar on the map.\n\n\u201cBefore when we started, the jaguar was virtually unknown,\u201d Ceballos said. \u201cRight now it\u2019s one of the most well-known species\u201d in Mexico.\n\nStill, at the current rate of population increase it would take 25 to 30 years for the jaguar to no longer be considered at risk of extinction in Mexico. Ceballos and his team aim to reduce that time to just 15 years.\n\nThere are many challenges in their way. Deforestation and loss of habitat continue to be a major issue: Mexico has lost 600,000 hectares of forest and jungle in the last six years. In the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula alone, the country loses 60,000 hectares of forest and jungle each year, vastly reducing the areas in which the jaguar can live and hunt.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

He hopes to work with social media companies to have pages marketing such products taken down.\n\nThe construction of new highways is a continuing challenge. Not only do they fragment a jaguar\u2019s territory but they increase the risk of the animals being run over. This can be mitigated by building specific points where animals such as jaguars can cross safely.\n\nThere is continuing conflict with cattle ranchers, and the spread of diseases from domesticated animals also poses a threat to the jaguar population.\n\nCeballos said a greater financial commitment to conservation from the federal government was needed, as well as support from the private sector, from scientists and from landowners to protect areas where jaguars may be living, if they were to meet their goal.\n\n\u201cWe are winning a battle in a war that is being lost. But it is a very important battle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives us hope that if we articulate the right policies, we can achieve great results.\u201d"

    "content": "When Jair Bolsonaro was Brazil\u2019s far-right president, the guerrilla trumpeter Fabiano Leit\u00e3o would stalk him around the capital, Bras\u00edlia, to taunt him with renditions of the anti-fascist anthem Bella Ciao.\n\nIn March, when Bolsonaro was charged with plotting a coup, Leit\u00e3o changed his tune and began provoking the ex-president by serenading him with Chopin\u2019s Funeral March. \u201cIt symbolises his political demise, which is what we want to see,\u201d said the 46-year-old musician.\n\nNow, as the supreme court prepares to decide whether to send Bolsonaro to jail for that alleged power grab, Leit\u00e3o is cooking up another performance to commemorate the populist\u2019s downfall and disgrace. \u201cIt\u2019ll be something happy! It has to be something happy!\u201d enthused the trumpeter, crooning one of the upbeat samba classics he was considering to mark the occasion.\n\n1:16 Fabiano Leit\u00e3o performs excerpt from Chopin\u2019s Funeral March outside Bolsonaro's home \u2013 video\n\n\u201cCry! I won\u2019t care!\u201d smirk the lyrics of Vou Festejar. \u201cI\u2019m going to celebrate your suffering [and] your grief!\u201d\n\nLeit\u00e3o is among millions of progressive Brazilians who have the metaphorical champagne on ice ahead of the widely anticipated conviction of Bolsonaro and seven alleged co-conspirators when their judgment begins this week.\n\nSeven years after the former paratrooper swept to power on a wave of social media-fuelled anti-establishment voter rage, and three after voters removed him from office, Bolsonaro is careering towards the lowest point of his 35-year political career.\n\nOn Tuesday, five supreme court judges will convene in Bras\u00edlia to rule on whether Bolsonaro is guilty of masterminding a failed coup after losing the 2022 election to his leftwing opponent, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2013 and, if so, how long he should spend in jail.\n\nLegal experts believe Bolsonaro\u2019s conviction is all but guaranteed during a judgment expected to last five sessions, between 2 September and 12 September. His sentence could reach 43 years, meaning the 70-year-old grandfather could spend the rest of his life behind bars. Bolsonaro stands accused of five crimes including involvement in an armed criminal organisation, coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and violently attempting to abolish Brazilian democracy.\n\nProsecutors have claimed one part of the sprawling conspiracy, codenamed Operation Green and Yellow Dagger, included plans to sow chaos \u2013 and justify a military intervention \u2013 by murdering Lula, his vice-president, Geraldo Alckmin, and Alexandre de Moraes, a supreme court judge, who is now overseeing Bolsonaro\u2019s trial.\n\nFederal police investigators allege the pro-Bolsonaro coup only failed because the heads of the army and air force, Gen Marco Ant\u00f4nio Freire Gomes and Brig Gen Carlos de Almeida Baptista J\u00fanior, refused to take part. The navy commander Adm Almir Garnier Santos, who is one of the seven alleged accomplices also standing trial, has been accused of offering his support, charges he denies.\n\n\u201cThe [prosecution\u2019s] closing arguments are really hard-hitting \u2013 there\u2019s so much evidence \u2026 It\u2019s really hard to imagine an acquittal,\u201d Elo\u00edsa Machado, a constitutional law expert from the Getulio Vargas Foundation law school, said of Bolsonaro.\n\nSuch predictions are music to the ears of Leit\u00e3o, the activist trumpeter, who hopes judges will throw the book at a politician he blames for trying to wreck Brazilian democracy and destroying Brazilian lives. During Bolsonaro\u2019s 2019-2022 presidency, hundreds of thousands of Brazilians were killed by a Covid pandemic that the ex-president was accused of mishandling with his anti-scientific response and sluggish purchase of vaccines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a moment of joy to see the country free itself of this instrument of destruction,\u201d said Leit\u00e3o, whom fans call the \u201cTrompetista\u201d \u2013 a play on the words \u201ctrumpeter\u201d and \u201cpetista\u201d, as members of Lula\u2019s Worker\u2019s party (PT) are known. \u201cWe always complain about our democracy and how fragile it is. But we\u2019re doing much better than the United States, which never arrested Trump.\u201d\n\nIn the run-up to this week\u2019s judgment, Donald Trump, who is Bolsonaro\u2019s most powerful foreign friend, has waded into the courtroom drama, imposing sanctions on Moraes, the justice leading the trial, and 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports in protest at the supposed \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d against his ally. \u201cIt\u2019s really a political execution that they\u2019re trying to do with Bolsonaro,\u201d Trump declared recently.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s third son, the congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, has relocated to the US and busied himself lobbying Trump officials to target Brazil\u2019s top tribunal and Lula allies such as the health minister, whose wife and daughter were stripped of their US visas. \u201cTrump is our only way out,\u201d the president of Bolsonaro\u2019s Liberal party, Valdemar Costa Neto, recently told reporters.\n\nAnalysts believe the US coercion campaign will fail to sway the judges who will decide Bolsonaro\u2019s fate. In a rare interview on the eve of the judgment, Moraes vowed to shrug off US pressure. \u201cThere isn\u2019t the smallest of possibilities of retreating even one millimetre,\u201d he told the Washington Post. \u201cWe\u2019ll do what\u2019s right: we\u2019ll receive the accusation, analyse the evidence, and who should be convicted shall be convicted, and who should be absolved shall be absolved.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro, who was placed under house arrest in early August after violating a court order banning him from using social media, denies engineering a coup. He has admitted considering \u201calternative\u201d ways of retaining power after his election defeat. The ex-president continues to insist he will challenge Lula for the presidency in next year\u2019s election, although the supreme court has already barred him from seeking office until 2030 for spreading disinformation.\n\nAfter hearing that Bolsonaro had been confined to his mansion a short drive from the presidential palace he once occupied, Leit\u00e3o grabbed his trumpet and rushed to the scene.\n\nAs night fell, the musician raised his instrument to his lips outside the gates of Bolsonaro\u2019s home and played an unusually cheery excerpt from Chopin\u2019s Piano Sonata No 2 into the night.\n\n\u201cThe message is that it\u2019s over,\u201d the guerrilla trumpeter said after his work was done. \u201cI\u2019m holding his political wake \u2013 and the burial is imminent.\u201d"

The other two judges on the panel were also nominated by Democratic presidents.\n\nIn an email, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) condemned the decision as more obstruction from \u201cunelected activist\u201d judges.\n\n\u201cFor decades the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program,\u201d the email read. \u201cWhile this injunction delays justice and undermines the integrity of our immigration system, Secretary Noem will use every legal option at the department\u2019s disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans.\u201d\n\nCongress authorized TPS as part of the Immigration Act of 1990. It allows the DHS secretary to grant legal immigration status to people fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disaster or other \u201cextraordinary and temporary conditions\u201d that prevent a safe return to that home country. The terms are for six, 12 and 18 months.\n\nThe appellate judges said the guaranteed time limitations were critical so people could gain employment, find long-term housing and build stability without fear of shifting political winds.\n\nBut in ending the protections soon after Trump took office, Noem said conditions in Venezuela had improved and it was not in the US national interest to allow migrants from there to stay on for what is a temporary program. It\u2019s part of a broader move by Trump\u2019s administration to reduce the number of immigrants who are in the country either without legal documentation or through legal temporary programs.\n\nThe US district judge Edward Chen of San Francisco found in March that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim that the administration had overstepped its authority in terminating the protections. Chen postponed the terminations, but the US supreme court reversed them without explanation, which is common in emergency appeals.\n\nIt is unclear what effect Friday\u2019s ruling will have on the estimated 350,000 Venezuelans in the group of 600,000 whose protections expired in April. Their lawyers say some have already been fired from jobs, detained in immigration jails, separated from their US citizen children and even deported.\n\nProtections for the remaining 250,000 Venezuelans are set to expire on 10 September.\n\n\u201cWhat is really significant now is that the second court unanimously recognized that the trial court got it right,\u201d said Emi MacLean, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Foundation of Northern California representing plaintiffs.\n\nShe added that while the decision might not benefit immediately those people who have already lost their status or are about to lose their status, Friday\u2019s ruling \u201cshould provide a path for the administration\u2019s illegal actions related to Venezuela and TPS to finally be undone\u201d."

    "content": "Indonesian political parties have agreed to cut some lawmakers\u2019 perks, including a controversial $3,000 housing allowance, the president said, as security measures were stepped up in an attempt to halt protests that have gripped the country for a week.\n\nPresident Prabowo Subianto, accompanied by leaders of eight Indonesian political parties, told a televised news conference in the capital, Jakarta, on Sunday that they had agreed to cut the housing allowance and suspend overseas trips for members of parliament.\n\nBy Monday, \u201clawmakers will see certain allowances scrapped and overseas work trips suspended under a new moratorium,\u201d said Prabowo, in a concession aimed at calming public anger.\n\nHe added he had ordered the military and police to take firm action in response to the burning and looting of some politicians\u2019 homes and state buildings.\n\nOn Monday, police set up checkpoints across Jakarta. Officers were also patrolling the city to \u201cprotect\u201d citizens and give a sense of security, a police spokesman told broadcaster Kompas TV.\n\n\n\nIndonesian students and civil society groups called off protests on Monday, citing fears of a crackdown by authorities.\n\nProtests first erupted a week ago, sparked by anger over the pay and privileges given to lawmakers, including a housing allowance of 50m rupiah ($3,075), which is nearly 10 times higher than the minimum wage in Jakarta. Anger escalated further after a motorcycle taxi driver, 21-year-old Affan Kurniawan, was run over by a police vehicle at a protest site on Thursday.\n\nA video apparently showing his death prompted an outcry against the security forces.\n\nWitnesses told local television that an armoured car from the National Police\u2019s mobile brigade unit suddenly sped through the crowd of demonstrators, hitting Kurniawan and running him over. Kurniawan had reportedly been trying to complete a food delivery order at the time.\n\nPrabowo has promised an investigation into his killing, and pledged to help his family. Seven officers have been detained for further investigation.\n\nView image in fullscreen President Prabowo Subianto meets the family of Affan Kurniawan, a ride-hailing driver Affan Kurniawan who was run over and killed by police during protests in Jakarta on Thursday.

The circumstances around his death remain unclear.\n\nAt least three people were killed in the eastern city of Makassar on Friday after a fire was started by protesters at a council building.\n\nAnother victim died in Makassar on Friday after he was beaten by a mob on suspicion that he was an intelligence officer, local disaster agency official Muhammad Fadli Tahar told Agence France-Presse on Sunday.\n\n\n\nProtests have taken place in multiple, including Yogyakarta, Bandung, Semarang and Surabaya in Java, and Medan in North Sumatra province.\n\nPrabowo reiterated that his government respects freedom of expression as guaranteed in Indonesia\u2019s constitution and international conventions.\n\n\u201cBut when demonstrations turn anarchic, destroying public facilities, endangering lives, and attacking private homes or public institutions, this becomes a serious violation of law,\u201d he said.\n\nPrabowo cautioned that violent acts risked veering into treason and terrorism, and warned \u201cthe state would not tolerate attempts to destabilise the country\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe homes of political party members and state buildings have been targeted by looters, including a house owned by finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, according to state news agency Antara reported on Sunday. She was not in the house at the time and it was not clear if she uses the property often, Reuters reported.\n\n\n\nThe crisis forced Prabowo to cancel a planned trip to China for a military parade commemorating the end of the second world war.\n\nTikTok, which has more than 100 million users in Indonesia, temporarily suspended its live feature in response to the protests.\n\n\n\nThe Alliance of Indonesian Women, a coalition of women-led civil society groups, said it had delayed planned protests at the parliament on Monday, fearing a crackdown by authorities. \u201cThe delay is done to avoid increased violent escalation by authorities ... the delay takes place until the situations calm down,\u201d the group said in an Instagram post on Sunday.\n\nStudent groups also delayed a protest on Monday, with one umbrella group saying the decision was \u201cdue to very impossible conditions\u201d.\n\nWith Associated Press"

    "content": "Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have met on the sidelines of a showpiece summit in China that seeks to challenge US-led, western-dominated blocs and is being attended by the leaders of more than two dozen nations.\n\nThe Chinese and Russian leaders, who are closely allied under what they have termed a \u201climitless\u201d partnership, discussed Putin\u2019s recent meeting with Donald Trump, according to a Kremlin official, who gave no further details.\n\nThe bilateral meeting was one of several for Xi on Sunday, who is hosting the annual Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin. The SCO is a 10-member bloc of Eurasian nations, and the summit is also being attended by the leaders of 16 observer or \u201cdialogue partner\u201d nations.\n\nXi personally welcomed several leaders including the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, before the delegates attended a formal reception.\n\nXi told the welcome reception that in the past century there had been a \u201csignificant increase in instability, uncertainty and unpredictable factors\u201d, and that the SCO had become an \u201cimportant force in promoting the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind\u201d.\n\nFootage published by Russian state media showed Xi and Putin, who arrived in Tianjin with an entourage of senior politicians and business representatives, warmly greeting each other at a photocall before calling in an interpreter for a lengthy and animated conversation.\n\nPutin and several other attenders are expected to stay on for a military parade in Beijing on Wednesday to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, which China refers to as the war of resistance against Japanese aggression. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is also expected to attend.\n\nThe Tianjin summit is the largest held by the bloc since it was formed in 2001. The SCO is a key part of Beijing\u2019s push for stronger multilateral alternatives to western or US-led blocs such as Nato.\n\nPutin told the Chinese state news agency Xinhua on Saturday that the SCO meeting would \u201cconsolidate solidarity\u201d among the Eurasian nations and \u201chelp shape a fairer multipolar world order\u201d.\n\nThe goal appears to have been helped by the upheaval brought by Trump\u2019s tariff regime and other foreign policy moves. Modi and Xi\u2019s meeting took place five days after Washington imposed punishing 50% tariffs on Indian goods due to Delhi\u2019s purchases of Russian oil.\n\nIt is Modi\u2019s first visit to China in seven years, and comes amid efforts by China and India to rebuild trade ties and resolve long-running Himalayan border disputes.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to progressing our relations based on mutual respect, trust and sensitivities,\u201d Modi said after meeting Xi.\n\nXi said China-India ties could be \u201cstable and far-reaching\u201d if both sides focused on viewing each other as partners instead of rivals, state media reported.\n\nIn a meeting with Erdo\u011fan, Xi said China and Turkey should strengthen cooperation in the area of counter-terrorism, according to Chinese state media. Xi also met leaders of the Maldives, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, and the autocratic leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, a key ally of Putin.\n\nThe bilateral talks were held at the Tianjin Guest House, an intimate venue surrounded by lush greenery. Large sections of Tianjin were closed to traffic and a significant police presence was deployed around the city.\n\nLim Chuan-Tiong, a researcher with the Institute for Advanced Studies on Asia at the University of Tokyo, said Putin and Xi meeting again was a sign of the continuation of their \u201climitless\u201d partnership, and closing ranks while both deal with a common foe \u2013 the US.\n\n\u201cAs long as the mutual opponent [US] has not been defeated, China and Russia\u2019s off-limits cooperation will remain,\u201d Lim said. \u201cTheir cooperation also serves to highlight a global order that exists beyond the United States.\u201d\n\nMoscow\u2019s claims over Ukraine and its full invasion in 2022, as well as Beijing\u2019s claim over Taiwan and threats to invade, have further isolated both governments from western and other democracies.\n\nRussian analysts have said the Ukraine war is now a main pillar of the bilateral relationship and that Moscow would want know how Beijing would respond if the US were to ask it to put pressure on Russia to end the fighting.\n\n\u201cThe longer the war [on Ukraine] drags on, the more Russia will need China\u2019s assistance, whether economically or other forms,\u201d Lim said. \u201cChina also recognises that it is unlikely for Sino-US relations to return to their pre-2018 state and thus has no choice but to accept a close alignment with Russia.\u201d\n\nBeijing purports to take a neutral stance on the Ukraine war but has become an economic lifeline for Russia, and Ukraine has accused it of providing direct aid to Moscow\u2019s campaign. The two countries have separately increased joint military drills.\n\nA Chinese academic who spoke on condition of anonymity said Moscow had expected more support from its ally but Beijing had been at pains to avoid further punitive sanctions.\n\n\u201cChina says there is \u2018no limit\u2019 but in practice it hesitates, constantly looking over its shoulder, wary of pressure from the west, the EU and Nato.

The announcement came after the president, Prabowo Subianto, appealed for calm and in a statement on Friday said he had ordered a \u201cthorough and transparent investigation\u201d into the death of the driver, Affan Kurniawan, and urged the public to trust his government.\n\nProtests in Makassar in eastern Indonesia descended into chaos on Friday outside city council buildings, which were set on fire, and vehicles were set ablaze as protesters hurled rocks and molotov cocktails.\n\nThree people were killed as a result of the fire at the Makassar city council building, its secretary, Rahmat Mappatoba, told AFP.\n\n\u201cThey were trapped in the burning building,\u201d he said, accusing protesters of storming the office to set the building on fire.\n\nView image in fullscreen Demonstrators throwing stones at riot police in Jakarta on Friday.

This is important because the war has become one of the main pillars of their relationship,\u201d he said.\n\nChina has emerged as an economic lifeline for Russia during the war in Ukraine, and Kyiv has been increasingly outspoken about what it says is China\u2019s direct aiding of Moscow\u2019s war effort.\n\nBilateral trade climbed to more than $240bn last year, two-thirds higher than before the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Beijing is now the leading buyer of Russian oil and coal and will shortly surpass Europe as Moscow\u2019s main market for natural gas.\n\nRussia\u2019s dependency on China is unlikely to go away even if the fighting stops, Gabuev said. \u201cRussia wants to know whether China will buy more oil and gas in the long term,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile trade hit a record high in 2024, it has since dipped amid a slump in Russian oil exports to China, a trend Putin will be eager to reverse in Beijing. Specifically, the two sides are expected to discuss the long-suggested Power of Siberia-2 gas pipeline and plans to expand the existing oil link into China.\n\nThe talks are also likely to touch on deepening military cooperation between Beijing and Moscow, a development that has alarmed western governments.\n\nWhile China has stopped short of providing direct military aid, US officials say Beijing has supplied about 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the semiconductors Russia needs to rebuild its war machine. In return, China is believed to be receiving assistance in sensitive defence technologies.\n\nChina claims it is a neutral mediator in the war in Ukraine, but the two countries have pulled closer together since the start of the invasion.\n\nRussia recently floated the idea that Beijing should be among Ukraine\u2019s security guarantors, reviving a proposal first put forward by Russian negotiators during talks in Turkey in spring 2022. Kyiv is likely to view the idea with scepticism.\n\nThere will be no shortage of symbolism during the visit. Putin is expected to sit alongside Xi at the military parade in Beijing on 3 September \u2013 a mirror image of the 9 May Victory Day celebrations in Moscow where the Chinese leader took pride of place as Chinese troops marched through Red Square beside their Russian counterparts.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square parade, like Russia\u2019s own Victory Day rituals, allows Beijing to invoke the memory of wartime triumphs as a way of affirming its great-power status, analysts say.\n\n\u201cRussia and China share a similar view of history, casting themselves as the victorious powers of the second world war. This sense of shared destiny now underpins their partnership,\u201d said Vasiliy Kashin, of the Institute of Far Eastern Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.\n\nKashin said the celebrations, with Kim present, could give a chance to smooth over any tensions surrounding Moscow\u2019s growing alliance with Pyongyang, a shift that has caused irritation in Beijing.\n\nChina has traditionally been North Korea\u2019s closest ally, but has lost some influence since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Kim has sent thousands of troops to support Moscow\u2019s war, and in return Russia has provided the isolated state with advanced missile and drone technology.\n\n\u201cJudging by Kim\u2019s invitation to Beijing, China is looking for ways to restore its relations with the North Koreans,\u201d Kashin said.\n\nPutin\u2019s visit will be closely watched in Washington, where Trump administration officials have promoted the policy of trying to prise Moscow away from Beijing and tilt it back towards the US.\n\nYet most analysts dismiss such hopes. \u201cRelations between Russia and China will always be close,\u201d Kashin said. \u201cA scenario in which Russia would turn against China, or China against Russia, is impossible.\u201d\n\nThe two leaders meet at a moment when each feels emboldened. China has managed to stave off a trade war with the US, which earlier this month extended its truce with Beijing for another 90 days as Washington sought to avoid reigniting a conflict that rattled global markets in the spring. Beijing flexed its muscle by imposing strict export controls on rare earths that threatened US manufacturing.\n\nTrump has also refrained from threatening secondary sanctions on Beijing over its purchases of Russian oil, while instead targeting India.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, has brushed aside Trump\u2019s threats of penalties unless it halts the war, clinging to its maximalist demands and intensifying its campaign against Ukraine.\n\nTellingly, the Trump administration has so far applied little pressure on Xi to push Putin towards ending the war. Observers said that while Beijing would prefer the fighting in Ukraine to stop, it is willing to tolerate the conflict so long as it can prioritise trade and diplomatic ties with Moscow and extract favourable terms.\n\n\u201cChina remains clear-eyed about the slim prospects for peace and sees little reason to accelerate talks,\u201d Gabuev said. \u201cThey know that Russia and Ukraine remain very far apart. No one is really asking China to step in \u2013 and that suits Beijing, since it can continue with imitation diplomacy without doing much in reality.\u201d"

    "content": "The contingent of neo-Nazis arrived at Flinders Street station about an hour before Sunday\u2019s anti-immigration rally was due to start.\n\nA hundred or so men, dressed in black, strode across Princes Bridge in a bloc, weaving through the large crowd that had already gathered under a sea of Australian flags.\n\nThere were plenty of people in the lead-up to the so-called March for Australia on Sunday, and many who attended, who said that the widespread promotion of the rally by known neo-Nazis did not mean it was organised by them; or that the presence of the National Socialist Network (NSN) in the crowd did not mean it was central to the day\u2019s message.\n\nEven if they were there, some said, you didn\u2019t have to agree with everything they said in order to attend.\n\nIn Melbourne, however, neo-Nazis were not just central to the march, they led it, all the way to the steps of parliament. And the National Socialist Network leader, Thomas Sewell, when he addressed the crowd to huge cheers, clearly laid out the role he envisioned for \u201cmy men\u201d in the \u201cfight for [Australia\u2019s] survival\u201d against \u201cginormous empires of the third world\u201d.\n\nMembers of the group allegedly went on to attack a First Nations protest site, Camp Sovereignty, in Melbourne\u2019s Kings Domain on Sunday evening.\n\nIn Sydney too, the New South Wales leader of the group spoke to cheers of \u201csend them back\u201d from onlookers as Australian flags flew in the background. Pamphlets were handed out for a far-right political party about the \u201cplague level\u201d of immigration.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nIn some cities, politicians spoke at the rallies. In the lead-up, parts of the media interviewed march organisers and showed the flyers on television.\n\n\u201cIt was only about recruitment,\u201d said Mario Peucker, an associate professor at Victoria University, of the presence of far-right figures on Sunday. \u201cIt was an opportunity to mingle with people who basically [are] their target group \u2026 presenting themselves as the only voice for them.\u201d\n\nVictoria police said it was too early to confirm whether the alleged attack on Camp Sovereignty or any of the other activity complained about at the rally would be investigated as \u201cprejudice-motivated\u201d, the force\u2019s term for offences that could also be described as hate crimes.\n\nFrom TikTok to the streets\n\nThe first mentions of a \u201cMarch for Australia\u201d came after the Palestine Action Group\u2019s March for Humanity, which saw massive crowds (police estimated 90,000 but organisers said the figure was closer to 300,000) walk across the Sydney Harbour Bridge on 3 August to oppose Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza.\n\nOnline, the event incensed several high-profile nationalist accounts, one of which made AI-generated images of the bridge covered in Australian flags.\n\nNot long later, a TikTok video emerged from an anonymous account. Over stock footage of Australian flags, it called for rallies on 31 August: \u201cWe finally stand up for ourselves and take this country back.\u201d\n\nA woman who goes by the name Bec Freedom online claimed to be in touch with the video creator, \u201ca young kid\u201d. In early August, she began responding to tweets from One Nation\u2019s Pauline Hanson and various online influencers with a poster calling for Australians \u201cto rise\u201d on 31 August.\n\nIn an X space on 11 August (where live audio conversations occur on the X platform), Bec said messaging should follow certain steps: \u201cSo, protect Australian heritage, culture, way of life. Next step, protect European culture, heritage, way of life. The next step is protect white heritage. So it all means the same thing.\n\n\u201cBy saying it that way, it is more appealing to the public. It\u2019s going to deter them from saying, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a Nazi rally, blah, blah, blah\u2019. \u2018Australian\u2019 is white.\u201d\n\nThe March for Australia website launched on 8 August and the ABC reported that an earlier version of the March for Australia websites included a reference to the white supremacist concept of \u201cremigration\u201d \u2013 the forced return of immigrants back to their country of origin. The ABC report makes clear it had been unable to establish exactly who is responsible for the website.\n\nAs the date approached, there was confusion about who the organisers of the rallies were in each state, although statements on the March for Australia Facebook page distanced the events from white supremacists.\n\n\u201cIn particular, recent claims by Thomas Sewell of White Australia are not reflective of the organisers nor the politics of March For Australia. We are not associated with their organisation,\u201d it posted on 12 August.\n\nIn a video on 22 August, Bec said she and other organisers were not members of any extremist group, and were not endorsing violence. \u201cAll we are doing is gathering en masse to fight for Australia,\u201d she said.\n\nThe rallies also brought together many elements of the pandemic-era anti-lockdown movement and others, but despite the messaging of the March for Australia accounts, Nazi groups clearly intended to capitalise off the events, issuing a press release in the lead-up claiming to have \u201cpositive ongoing contact with the event organisers nationwide\u201d and promising that members would be speaking at March for Australia events.\n\nIn response, Bec posted on Facebook that she was no longer involved with the Melbourne event. \u201cThe National Socialist Network will not be stopped or banned from attending the March For Australia events,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnyone who shares similar opinions on the reason for these events is welcome to attend, so long as they are not causing any trouble or being violent. Anyone causing trouble or being violent will be removed.\u201d\n\nShe also said \u201cjust remember that there will be people there that we don\u2019t all necessarily agree with entirely, but if we are all able to come together in unity under this message and our flag, then we can really make a visual impact that we are not happy with the state of Australia as it currently stands\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Free newsletter Get the most important news as it breaks Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This movement urges members to raise British flags around the country and post photos, and the 31 August events in Australia was praised in turn by British \u201cpatriot\u201d accounts.\n\nAurelien Mondon, a UK-based academic who attended the recent protests there, has written extensively about how immigration is often used by those on the far right to appeal to the mainstream.\n\nHe also says it is important not to describe such movements as \u201cpopulist\u201d, even when they involve the support of politicians.\n\n\u201cWhen we allow the far right to be described as populist, we are incorrectly implying that they are tapping into what the people want or that they speak for the \u2018silent majority\u2019,\u201d Mondon and a fellow academic, Alex Yates, wrote in a piece for the Conversation last year.\n\nIn February, Mike Burgess, Asio\u2019s director general, used his annual threat assessment to outline the spectre of the far right. \u201cWe expect nationalist and racist violent extremists to continue their efforts to \u2018mainstream\u2019 and expand their movement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey will undertake provocative, offensive and increasingly high-profile acts to generate publicity and recruit.\n\n\u201cWhile these activities will test legal boundaries, the greatest threat of violence comes from individuals on the periphery of these organised groups.\u201d\n\nRallies represent a new escalation\n\nWhile there was a range of grievances on display about perceived immigration rates on Sunday, it was clear for many that the return to an imagined white Australia was a central theme.\n\nFor Jordan McSwiney, who researches the far right at the University of Canberra, the weekend\u2019s rallies brought to mind the 2015-2017 anti-Islam and anti-immigration street protests of Reclaim Australia.\n\nThis time, however, far-right groups were not shielding their involvement.\n\nMcSwiney noted how \u201ceasy it has been for the NSN to basically use the shield of \u2018ordinary mums and dads\u2019 to sell white supremacy to a big crowd of people who may very well have genuine concerns \u2026 that won\u2019t be fixed by stopping immigration.\u201d\n\n2:10 Faruqi on March for Australia: racism has been 'legitimised' by media and politicians \u2013 video\n\nIn his view, the recent response of state and federal governments to these movements \u2013 banning known Nazi symbols, for example \u2013 has been a distraction, and has not made it meaningfully more difficult for neo-Nazis to organise and recruit in Australia. As has been the \u201csoftball condemnations\u201d of some politicians in response to the rallies \u2013 and the presence of others.\n\nFor Peucker, Sunday\u2019s rallies represent a new escalation that demonstrated how the views of some who consider themselves \u201cpart of the ordinary Aussie mainstream\u201d overlap with the political agenda of openly white nationalist groups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that white supremacy, which was present clearly yesterday, is something that the neo-Nazis in some evil, secretive fashion introduced into the political mainstream,\u201d Peucker said. \u201cIt is something that has always been present in parts of the mainstream.\u201d\n\nMarch for Australia and Bec Freedom were approached for comment."

Some were put on display in Bristol for a while, but all have been in storage for at least half a century.\n\nMikayla Lee, a Larrakia woman and a member of the advisory group for the Larrakia cultural centre, described the recovery of the objects as overwhelming. \u201cIt\u2019s very moving, emotional, a special moment,\u201d she said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Close by were artefacts taken from Nigeria and China, and the council said it would continue to work on repatriations of objects taken by British colonialists.\n\nThe leader of the council, Tony Dyer, said he was proud of the work that had been done with the Larrakia people and that other objects may be repatriated to other countries. \u201cI think there is much for us to learn from this and much to share with others,\u201d he said.\n\nSome Larrakia people who could not make it to Bristol had sent moving reactions to images they had been shown of the pieces.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fishing spear. That\u2019s really old that style,\u201d said Roque Lee, a Larrakia man. \u201cYou don\u2019t see that sort of spear now days.

He said waiting any longer would be dangerous and expensive, and criticised those who deny the realities of global heating in Spain. Over the past five years, he said, the climate emergency had caused more than 20,000 deaths and cost the public purse \u20ac32bn (\u00a328bn) in material losses. We need to mobilise as a society against climate change, which is a common enemy that lies beyond ideologies. He added: \u201cClimate change kills. It kills.

He said waiting any longer would be dangerous and expensive, and criticised those who deny the realities of global heating in Spain. Over the past five years, he said, the climate emergency had caused more than 20,000 deaths and cost the public purse \u20ac32bn (\u00a328bn) in material losses. We need to mobilise as a society against climate change, which is a common enemy that lies beyond ideologies. He added: \u201cClimate change kills. It kills.

The Slovak PM repeatedly faced criticism at home and abroad for maintaining close relations with Russia, including his visit to Moscow in December last year to meet with Vladimir Putin and in May to attend the Russian Victory Day parade. He also repeatedly clashed with Ukraine over energy and attempted to delay EU sanctions on Moscow, and so this topic could come up during his meeting with Zelenskyy this week.

Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images Von der Leyen was travelling to Plovdiv on Sunday when her charter plane lost electronic navigation aids, delaying its arrival in the central Bulgarian city. Interference with satellite navigation has become increasingly common in airspace near Russia and it remains unclear whether von der Leyen was deliberately targeted. Asked about this point, EU spokesperson said: \u201cThe question is best asked to the Russians.\u201d The incident happened during a four-day trip by von der Leyen to seven EU member states on the bloc\u2019s eastern border. In Vilnius on Monday, von der Leyen did not mention the incident, but spoke of \u201cconstant military and hybrid threats\u201d facing Lithuania. In March 2024, Russia was believed to have been responsible for jamming the signal of a plane carrying the then UK defence secretary, Grant Shapps, who was returning to the UK from Poland. The RAF plane experienced GPS interference for about 30 minutes while it flew near the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. It was reported at the time that it was unclear whether Shapps was the target. GPS jamming and \u201cspoofing\u201d \u2013 an electronic warfare tactic that causes incorrect navigation information to be displayed \u2013 has increased since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and escalated even more sharply in the last year.

Poland recorded 2,732 cases of electronic interference in January 2025, up from 1,908 in October 2023, while Lithuania recorded 1,185, up from 556 in March 2024, according to an internal EU document drafted in May. The document describes interference to global satellite navigation systems as \u201cnot random incidents but a systemic, deliberate action by Russia and Belarus\u201d.

    "content": "Europe is on the verge of abandoning its role as a mediator between the US and Iran and instead handing the Iran nuclear file over to Donald Trump\u2019s veto, Iran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson has said in an interview with the Guardian in Tehran.\n\nEsmail Baghaei said that as soon as UN-wide sanctions were reimposed at Europe\u2019s demand in less than 30 days\u2019 time, the US would regain its security council veto over what happens next, including the continuance of sanctions.\n\n\u201cThe Europeans are doing what Trump dictated to them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Europeans\u2019 role is going to be diminished. If you go back to the European foreign policy leaders in the history of the nuclear deal, Javier Solana, Cathy Ashton, Federica Mogherini, Josep Borrell, they all tried to liaise between Iran and the US.\n\n\u201cThey tried to prove they were credible negotiating partners. But now the Europeans have decided to be the proxy of the US and Israel. It is absolutely irresponsible of them to hand over that role to the US.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted the claim by Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, that Israel was doing \u201cthe dirty work \u2026 for all of us\u201d by attacking Iran\u2019s nuclear sites in June. \u201cIn a way, all of the European countries condoned what Israel did, and very likely provided information to the Israeli regime,\u201d Baghaei said.\n\nHis remarks may be designed to put pressure on European capitals to distance themselves from the US and tone down the conditions they have set before they will agree to defer UN sanctions.\n\nBaghaei also said the Iranian government was not constitutionally able to block Iran\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) if the Iranian parliament went ahead and passed a law withdrawing from it in response to the European reimposition of UN sanctions. Withdrawal from the treaty was the prerogative of parliament, he said.\n\nThe number of MPs backing an NPT withdrawal bill is due to be revealed on Tuesday but MPs said the measure was likely to be rushed through parliament with overwhelming support. Withdrawal from the NPT would mean the UN loses all rights to oversee Iran\u2019s nuclear programme and would inevitably raise US concerns about whether Iran will build a nuclear bomb covertly or overtly.\n\nThe powerful factions in the parliament seem convinced that Iran has the firepower to inflict heavy damage on Israel in the event of a second western attack.\n\n\u201cWe are prepared because this is a matter of our dignity and sovereignty,\u201d Baghaei said. \u201cI think you in the UK had your blitz spirit when attacked by Nazi Germany. We have the same spirit because we knew this war imposed on us in the middle of negotiations was so unjust.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen A billboard in Tehran of nuclear centrifuges and the sentence: \u2018Science is the power, and the Iranian nation will not abandon its religion and knowledge.\u2019 Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\nThe three European signatories to the original nuclear deal \u2013 France Germany and the UK \u2013 notified the UN last Thursday that they intended to use their right to reimpose UN-wide sanctions at the end of September unless Iran met three conditions: a return of UN weapons inspectors to the bombed Iranian nuclear sites, the handover of details of the whereabouts of its 400kg stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and agreement to open talks with America on the future of its nuclear programme.\n\nEurope says there is still room for diplomacy in the coming four weeks to reach an agreement on these conditions. Baghaei described the European conditions as \u201ca sign they are not serious and they do not have good faith\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is an extreme trust deficit between the UN weapons inspectors from IAEA and Iran. There is a real concern that the information gathered at the sites by the IAEA would end up being passed on to Israel.\n\n\u201cIt has been a real concern especially after the highly politicised approach of the IAEA. We cannot ignore the fact that previous IAEA reports were abused by America and Israel to craft the resolution to the IAEA board which claimed that Iran was not in compliance with its obligations.\u201d He said that resolution was used as a pretext for the Israeli attack on Iran in June.\n\nHe conceded that Iran\u2019s room for diplomatic manoeuvre at the UN in the next month was limited because of the public mood in Iran.\n\n\u201cThe fact is our public is outraged because of the unlawful attacks on our facilities and as a government we have to be accountable to our people and to our parliament,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe western media goes on about our cooperation with the IAEA and stockpiles, but the western public has to remember the outrageous [acts] committed by Israel and the US. They torpedoed the diplomatic process, they attacked the rule of international law because our facilities have been under inspection 24 hours a day for throughout the past three decades.\u201d\n\nIranian officials insist that the aim remains to reach a compromise in the next month that will allow the weapons inspectors to return. Iranian diplomats have given assurances to the IAEA that the stockpiles have not been moved. They also insist they are willing to speak to the Americans, but repeated messages sent to Washington have not been met with any response so far.\n\nBaghaei said Iran was willing to reduce the purity level to which it enriched uranium back to 3.67%, the level set in the old nuclear deal, so long as an overall agreement was reached that preserves Iran\u2019s right to enrich uranium domestically.\n\nHe questioned why the US was so intent on removing Iran\u2019s right to enrich if, as Trump claimed, Iran\u2019s ability to undertake such enrichment had been already destroyed by the joint US-Israeli attacks."

    "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to influence the US Federal Reserve could pose a \u201cvery serious danger\u201d for the world economy, the head of the European Central Bank has warned.\n\nChristine Lagarde, the president of the ECB, said Trump undermining the independence of the world\u2019s most powerful central bank would have an impact for the US and other countries.\n\nSteps by the US president to remove the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, or the governor Lisa Cook would be a \u201cvery serious danger for the US economy and the world economy\u201d, Lagarde told the French broadcaster Radio Classique.\n\n\u201cIf US monetary policy were no longer independent and instead dependent on the dictates of this or that person, then I believe that the effect on the balance of the American economy could, as a result of the effects this would have around the world, be very worrying, because it is the largest economy in the world,\u201d she said, according to remarks reported by Reuters.\n\nTrump has repeatedly criticised Powell for not cutting interest rates and has threatened to fire him. He is also attempting to remove Cook, who is appealing against the decision in a case that could reach the US supreme court.\n\nIn court on Friday, lawyers for Cook argued that she could not be fired without the notice or \u201ccause\u201d required to remove a Fed governor. She learned of her attempted removal via a post on social media, they said.\n\nSacking Cook, whose term is not due to expire until 2038, would enable Trump to nominate a replacement. However, Cook has argued that the president has \u201cno authority\u201d to remove her.\n\nLagarde said it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d for Trump to take control of Fed decision-making on interest rates. \u201cThe US supreme court, which is largely respected in the country and therefore I hope will be respected by [Trump] as well, has clearly indicated that a Fed governor can only be dismissed in the case of gross misconduct.\u201d\n\nTrump received backing for his assault on the Fed last week from Liz Truss, the shortest-serving British prime minister in history, who was ousted after a meltdown in the financial markets.\n\nLeading investors and economists have said political interference damages the credibility of central banks to keep inflation under control. US government borrowing costs have risen in recent months amid concern about the impact Trump\u2019s tariff policies could have and questions about Fed independence.\n\nBorrowing costs have also risen across other advanced economies. The rise is linked to the uncertainty in the US, alongside investor worries about elevated debt levels in several nations and the return of inflation after the Covid pandemic, and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nLong-term borrowing costs for the UK government have risen close to the highest levels in 30 years, while the yield \u2013 in effect the interest rate \u2013 on French government debt has also risen amid a political crisis for President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, she signalled that Paris was unlikely to need emergency support from the IMF, playing down a suggestion made by the country\u2019s finance minister, Eric Lombard, late last month.\n\nLagarde said the French banking system was better placed now than it was during the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cCountries request IMF intervention in circumstances of serious budgetary deficit or when a country cannot meet its financial obligations \u2026 I do not believe that the banking system itself is in any way the source of the current risk \u2013 but markets, in all circumstances of this nature, assess the risk.\u201d"

The latter has said France intends to recognise Palestine at the UN meeting.\n\nStarmer also spoke to Donald Trump before announcing his decision. The US president indicated the US would not object to such a move, but British officials are worried that his administration might retaliate by recognising Israeli jurisdiction over illegal settlements in the West Bank.\n\nStarmer\u2019s conditions for Israel include taking \u201csubstantive steps\u201d to end the war in Gaza, agreeing a ceasefire and committing not to annex parts of the West Bank.\n\nFar from taking steps towards satisfying any of those demands, however, Netanyahu has shown signs of violating them further.\n\nReuters reported that Israel was considering annexation in the West Bank if France, the UK and other countries push ahead with recognising Palestine. Israeli officials said the subject was on the agenda for Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet meeting on Sunday, but would not say where or when annexation could happen.\n\nThe Foreign Office has just over a week to complete its formal assessment of Israel\u2019s position. Senior government officials say the timing of the British recognition is being driven less by that process and more by diplomatic concerns that the government should be seen to be acting in concert with France.\n\nLammy said on Sunday that the humanitarian situation in Gaza, where UN-backed experts recently declared a famine, was a \u201cman-made catastrophe\u201d caused by Israel\u2019s refusal to let in aid deliveries.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About 800 people died and 2,500 others were injured in Kunar, spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told a press conference in Kabul, adding that the toll of 12 dead and 255 injured in the Nangarhar province had not changed.\n\nFilippo Grandi , the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, said the earthquake intensified existing humanitarian challenges in Afghanistan and urged international donors to support relief efforts. \u201cThis adds death and destruction to other challenges including drought and the forced return of millions of Afghans from neighbouring countries,\u201d Grandi wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nRescuers are operating across Afghanistan\u2019s east, with helicopters helping bring the injured to safety, while rubble is combed through in the hunt for survivors.

He said that rescue teams have been struggling to reach wounded people because significant numbers are waiting to be airlifted by helicopters as landslides have closed most of roads.\n\nMore than 1.2 million people likely felt strong or very strong shaking after Sunday\u2019s earthquake, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), which recorded at least five aftershocks throughout the night. As a reminder, the magnitude 6 earthquake hit four provinces in eastern Afghanistan around midnight on Sunday, with the rugged, mountainous region of Kunar the worst affected, triggering landslides and flooding.\n\nThe Afghan Red Crescent said its officials and medical teams have \u201crushed to the affected areas\u201d of the earthquake and are \u201cproviding emergency assistance to impacted families\u201d.\n\nHumanitarian agencies say they are fighting a forgotten crisis in Afghanistan, where the United Nations estimates more than half the population is in urgent need of humanitarian aid. \u201cSo far, no foreign governments have reached out to provide support for rescue or relief work,\u201d a spokesperson of Afghanistan\u2019s foreign office said on Monday.\n\nRescuers have been battling to reach remote mountainous areas cut off from mobile networks along the Pakistani border, where mudbrick homes dotting the slopes collapsed in the quake. \u201cThe area of the earthquake was affected by heavy rain in the last 24-48 hours as well, so the risk of landslides and rock slides is also quite significant - that is why many of the roads are impassable,\u201d Kate Carey , an officer at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Unocha) , told Reuters.\n\nOne resident in Afghanistan\u2019s Nurgal district , one of the worst-affected areas in Kunar, said almost the entire village had collapsed under the force of the earthquake. \u201cChildren are under the rubble. The elderly are under the rubble. Young people are under the rubble,\u201d the villager, who did not give his name, told the Associated Press.\n\nMuhammad Aziz, a labourer from Kunar\u2019s Nur Gul district, said 10 of his relatives, including his five children, had been killed in the earthquake and many people from his village remained trapped under the rubble. \u201cThe poor people in this area have lost everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is death in every home, and beneath the rubble of each roof, there are dead bodies.\u201d Share\n\n45m ago 12.14 EDT One survivor described seeing homes collapse before his eyes and people screaming for help. Sadiqullah, who lives in the Maza Dara area of Nurgal, said he was woken by a deep boom that sounded like a storm approaching. Like many Afghans, he uses only one name. He ran to where his children were sleeping and rescued three of them. He was about to return to grab the rest of his family when the room fell on top of him. \u201cI was half-buried and unable to get out,\u201d he told the Associated Press by phone from Nangarhar Hospital. \u201cMy wife and two sons are dead, and my father is injured and in hospital with me. We were trapped for three to four hours until people from other areas arrived and pulled me out.\u201d It felt like the whole mountain was shaking, he said.

Powerful tremors were shaking his small house in Piran village in Afghanistan\u2019s Kunar region and he could see the walls beginning to crack. \u201cI jumped out of bed and rushed to where my children and parents were sleeping,\u201d said Jan. \u201cI managed to rescue two of my children and brought them outside to safety. I went back inside to save my younger siblings, but as I did, the roof and walls collapsed around me.\u201d As the magnitude-6 earthquake hit eastern Afghanistan late on Sunday night, Jan found himself buried in the rubble of his own house. As much as he tried to claw at the debris, he struggled to push his head through the wreckage. It took local villagers five hours to finally free him. But when he finally broke through, he was greeted with scenes of tragedy and devastation. His wife, two sons and two brothers were among those killed when the powerful earthquake struck, razing entire villages across the region to the ground. In the poverty-stricken, mountainous terrain of Kunar, most homes in the affected villages had been made only of mud, giving people little defence from the debris and floods caused by the earthquake when it struck as they slept. Most homes lay in a pile of rubble or washed away entirely. \u201cIt felt as if the entire mountain was collapsing on us,\u201d said Jan. \u201cOur village has been completely devastated and residential areas wiped out.\u201d \u2018The walls collapsed around me\u2019: Afghans describe quake devastation Read more Share\n\n2h ago 10.47 EDT An unnamed but high-ranking Taliban official in the Kunar province has told BBC News that the rescue mission is now focused on finding survivors, not the dead. He said that rescue teams have been struggling to reach wounded people because significant numbers are waiting to be airlifted by helicopters as landslides have closed most of roads. He told the BBC Afghan Service: The scale of devastation is unimaginable, entire villages are flattened, roads to deep mountainous areas are still closed. So now, for us, the priority is not finding dead under the rubble, but rather reaching out to those injured. The official added: Most of the dead bodies are under rubble. We are doing everything, but it doesn\u2019t seem possible soon.

    "content": "It was almost midnight when Hameed Jan was jolted awake in his bed by a deep rumble. Powerful tremors were shaking his small house in Piran village, in Afghanistan\u2019s Kunar region, and he could see the walls beginning to crack.\n\n\u201cI jumped out of bed and rushed to where my children and parents were sleeping,\u201d Jan said. \u201cI managed to rescue two of my children and brought them outside to safety. I went back inside to save my younger siblings, but as I did the roof and walls collapsed around me.\u201d\n\nAs the magnitude-6 earthquake hit eastern Afghanistan late on Sunday night, Jan found himself buried in the rubble of his own house. As much as he tried to claw at the debris, he struggled to push his head through the wreckage. It took villagers five hours to finally free him. When he finally broke through, he was greeted with scenes of tragedy and devastation.\n\nHis wife, two sons and two brothers were among the dead after the powerful earthquake had razed entire villages across the region to the ground. In the poverty-stricken, mountainous terrain of Kunar, most homes in the affected villages had been made only of mud, giving people little defence from the debris and floods caused by the earthquake when it struck as they slept. Most homes lay in piles of rubble or had been washed away entirely.\n\nView image in fullscreen Damaged buildings in Kunar. Photograph: EPA\n\n\u201cIt felt as if the entire mountain was collapsing on us,\u201d Jan said. \u201cOur village has been completely devastated and residential areas wiped out.\u201d\n\nThe official death toll stood at 800 on Monday evening, with more than 2,500 injured, and was widely expected to rise significantly. Many in the villages of Kunar remained unaccounted for and rescuers continued to pull bodies from the rubble as all local hospitals declared a state of emergency.\n\nThe Taliban, who took control of the country more than four years ago when its internationally recognised government collapsed, dispatched helicopters but many areas remained impossible to access.\n\n0:46 Rescue efforts after Afghanistan earthquake kills more than 800 \u2013 video\n\nSanaullah, another resident of Kunar province, had been away from his village when the earthquake struck. When he travelled back on Monday, he found that his house had been reduced to rubble and his brother had been killed alongside his five children. \u201cIt is the story of each and every house here,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone I know here has lost at least three to five family members.\u201d\n\nAbdul Rahim, a cleric in Kunar, said graveyards in Mazar valley in Kunar were now overflowing with the dead. \u201cEverywhere people are crying and embracing one another following a mass funeral,\u201d he said. \u201cThe death toll is so high that graveyards are overflowing, and local people are busy digging graves in advance as bodies arrive every half hour.\u201d\n\nMany of those affected were critical of the rescue efforts by the Taliban, which was widely seen to lack the resources, manpower and funds to deal with a crisis on this scale. Since the Taliban retook power in 2021, it has become increasingly difficult for NGOs to operate in the country, particularly amid the draconian ban on women\u2019s employment and education, and most foreign governments have withdrawn aid from Afghanistan, now one of the poorest countries in the world.\n\nView image in fullscreen Afghan men search for their belongings in the rubble of a collapsed house. Photograph: Reuters\n\nSohail Shaheen, a Taliban spokesperson, called on international organisations to step in and offer assistance in the wake of the disaster. \u201cMany villages are not accessible yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI fear the casualties are very high.\u201d\n\nOne resident from the Maza Dara area, who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely, criticised the Taliban rescue efforts. \u201cThere are women and children pleading for help but there are no authorities present to help them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEveryone is trapped under the rubble and we are helpless and seeing them dying in front of our eyes,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is no one here to help those buried and alive in the debris. There is no one here to remove the dead.\u201d"

    "content": "A powerful earthquake that hit mountainous eastern Afghanistan has left at least 800 people confirmed dead and injured about 2,500, Taliban officials have said as rescuers struggled to reach the worst-hit villages.\n\nThe magnitude-6 earthquake struck several provinces close to the Pakistan border around midnight on Sunday, with the rugged region of Kunar the most severely affected. There were landslides and flooding.\n\nThe earthquake was shallow, taking place close to Earth\u2019s surface, which is known to cause greater destruction. Several aftershocks were reported throughout the night and into Monday morning, which could even be felt in the capital, Kabul, more than 100 miles away.\n\nThe Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed that the death toll had exceeded 800 by Monday afternoon and that rescue efforts were continuing to recover those trapped beneath mud and debris. However, those efforts were hampered as roads to affected areas were destroyed or blocked by rubble from the earthquake, and the terrain of the region is steep and treacherous.\n\nThe death toll is expected to rise significantly as local hospitals reported being inundated with casualties, and hundreds of people remain unaccounted for. Medics at the provincial hospital in Asadabad in Kunar described the situation as an overwhelming crisis, with new patients arriving every few minutes.\n\nRasheed Khan, a 40-year-old cloth merchant in Kabul originally from Kunar\u2019s Watpur village, said his wife, children and brothers were among the dead. \u201cIt\u2019s doomsday for me. I have lost my wife, three children and two brothers, and I don\u2019t know what has happened to my other relatives and fellow villagers,\u201d he said while returning to his native village from the capital.\n\n\u201cI fear thousands still remain trapped under the rubble, and I don\u2019t know if they will be saved or not,\u201d Khan said.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s defence ministry said it had dispatched 30 doctors and truckloads of medicine to Kunar to assist local hospitals, according to the state-run Bakhtar news agency.\n\nThe Taliban urged humanitarian organisations to assist with rescue efforts in areas that could only be reached by air because of the landslides and flooding. Officials emphasised the urgent need for field hospitals, medical aid, rescue equipment, shelter, food and clean drinking water.\n\nSince the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in 2021 and installed a hardline regime \u2013 including heavy restrictions on women\u2019s employment and education \u2013 there has been a significant withdrawal of foreign aid and assistance to the country. This has pushed the country\u2019s healthcare system to the brink of collapse and severely undermined its capacity to respond to disasters.\n\nJeremy Smith, the country manager for Afghanistan for the Red Cross, which is taking part in the rescue operation, said the remote location of the earthquake made efforts particularly challenging. \u201cThere have been repeated aftershocks and more are feared in the coming days,\u201d he said.\n\nKunar is a poor, mountainous region where homes are primarily constructed of mud and rocks. The epicentre of the earthquake was close to the bustling trade city of Jalalabad, near the border with Pakistan. Swaths of the city\u2019s buildings are low-rise and informal constructions, mostly made of concrete and brick, which are particularly vulnerable to earthquakes.\n\nMuhammad Aziz, a labourer from Kunar\u2019s Nur Gul district, said 10 of his relatives, including his five children, were killed in the earthquake and many people from his village remained trapped under the rubble.\n\n\u201cThe poor people in this area have lost everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is death in every home, and beneath the rubble of each roof there are dead bodies. The mud houses have been wiped away and destruction is everywhere. People are desperately seeking help.\u201d\n\nThere were reports that some remote villages were yet to receive any rescue assistance due to damaged access routes. Rescue workers in Nur Gul said a journey usually of two hours to reach one village, Masood, was now taking eight while many other villages could be accessed only on foot.\n\nNearly everyone in Masood has lost family members, and many people are believed trapped under the rubble. Rescue workers said the death toll could be as high as 250.\n\nIn Laghman province, officials reported at least 30 injuries, mostly among women. Tremors were also felt in Nuristan, but damage assessments there are still pending.\n\nThe disaster comes with Afghanistan, one of the poorest countries in the world, already in the midst of a severe economic crisis, exacerbated by the suspension of US foreign aid earlier this year, which has forced hospitals and health clinics to shut down.\n\nThe country is also grappling with the impact of the forced return of more than 2 million Afghan nationals from neighbouring Iran and Pakistan. According to the United Nations, more than half of Afghanistan\u2019s 42 million population is already in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nChina said it was ready to provide disaster relief assistance \u201caccording to Afghanistan\u2019s needs and within its capacity\u201d and India said it had delivered 1,000 family tents to Kabul and was moving 15 tonnes of food material to Kunar, with more to be sent from Tuesday.\n\nThe UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said its mission in Afghanistan was preparing to help those in areas devastated by the quake. Pope Leo sent condolences for the dead.\n\nAfghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. A series of earthquakes in its west killed more than 1,000 people last year.\n\nA magnitude-6.3 earthquake struck Afghanistan on 7 October 2023, followed by strong aftershocks. The Taliban government estimated that at least 4,000 people died. The UN gave a far lower death toll of about 1,500. It was the deadliest natural disaster to strike Afghanistan in recent memory."

Yet clandestine salons have continued to operate within communities across the country.\n\nNow, the Taliban have said that they intend to root out and eliminate these underground businesses, issuing orders to community leaders and elders across the country that they must identify clandestine beauty salons and report those running them to the \u201cvice and virtue\u201d police.\n\nFrestha, a 38-year-old mother of three young children, said she had been operating her beauty salon business in secret since they were banned in 2023 because she had no choice but to work and no other way of earning money.\n\n\u201cWhen the Taliban closed our salons, I was the only breadwinner in my family; my husband was sick, and I had three children whose expenses I had to cover,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut also I kept working because I feel so good when I could bring beauty back to a woman.

    "content": "The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, will land in China this weekend for his first visit in seven years \u2013 a trip that puts him in the company of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, just as India\u2019s ties with Washington have soured.\n\nModi\u2019s visit to Tianjin for a regional security summit comes days after the US doubled tariffs on Indian exports to 50%, citing New Delhi\u2019s refusal to stop buying Russian oil.\n\nThe row has upended years of deepening cooperation between India and the US, built on technology and a shared determination to counter Beijing\u2019s global ambitions. It has also forced India to aggressively look elsewhere to diversify its trade.\n\n\u201cIndian trust in the US is shattered,\u201d the South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether US officials fully realise how much trust they have squandered in such a short time.\u201d\n\nFor China, the two-day Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit that starts on Sunday could not be better timed. Modi \u201cwill be in China at a moment when India-China relations are stabilising and India-US relations have gone south. It is a powerful optic,\u201d Kugelman said.\n\n\u201cNo doubt there are some in China who are revelling in the trade tensions between India and the US,\u201d said Manoj Kewalramani, the head of Indo-Pacific studies at the Takshashila Institution in Bengaluru.\n\nPutin would want to \u201ccapitalise on the moment by reasserting Russia\u2019s close relationship with India\u201d, Kugelman said, adding that it would be \u201ca great moment for everyone to stick out their tongues at Washington\u201d.\n\nWashington has pointed to India\u2019s continuing purchases of Russian crude oil and defence hardware as the reason for the tariff increase, arguing that Delhi is helping fund Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine.\n\nAs Modi began his trip, Donald Trump\u2019s trade adviser Peter Navarro stepped up his attack on India, claiming on X that the country had become an \u201coil money laundromat for the Kremlin\u201d.\n\nIndia has consistently defended its Russian oil purchases, saying they are vital to keep energy costs stable in the vast developing economy, help steady prices globally and comply with international law. Modi has tried to strike a balance over the Ukraine war, refusing to criticise Moscow directly while urging peace.\n\nThe economic blow of the tariffs is immense. The US is India\u2019s biggest export market at $86.5bn a year, and two-thirds of that \u2013 about $60.2bn in goods \u2013 is subject to the new duties, hitting labour-intensive sectors from textiles to jewellery.\n\nEven before the tariffs, India had been cautiously warming to China as a source of investment and technology and in hopes of boosting trade.\n\nRelations froze after a deadly clash along their disputed Himalayan border in 2020 but began to thaw when Modi and Xi met in person for the first time in four years at a Brics summit in Russia in October. Now, \u201cthe US-India crisis has given Modi good cause to accelerate efforts to ease tensions\u201d, Kugelman said.\n\nModi is expected to meet Xi on the sidelines of the regional summit, with trade and investment high on the agenda.\n\n\u201cAn effort is under way to see if India and China can reach some sort of new equilibrium,\u201d Kewalramani said. \u201cBoth recognise that the world order is in flux. Neither is likely to decisively manage all the frictions but there\u2019s at least a process of trying to grow the relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistorical mistrust will remain,\u201d he added, pointing to their contested frontier that China continues to reinforce with new roads, railways and settlements. \u201cBut if Delhi and Beijing can create a measure of stability and predictability, without expecting structural breakthroughs, there are practical gains to be had.\u201d\n\nRussia, too, stands to benefit from India\u2019s rift with the US, with Delhi seeing the relationship as more vital than ever for balancing ties with the west, diversifying military hardware purchases and ensuring energy security.\n\nFor Modi, the photos of him standing alongside Xi and Putin at the summit \u201cwill send a pointed message to Washington\u201d, a retired Indian diplomat said.\n\nIndian officials stress Delhi wishes to continue its ties with the US, but also needs to \u201cdiversify its partnerships\u201d. India cannot \u201cafford to appear as though it is giving in to US pressure on oil imports, or anything else that could be construed as a capitulation \u2013 and public anger is high\u201d, said one official who could not be named.\n\nOn Thursday, the Indian government fired its first shot to offset the US tariffs, rolling out an export drive across 40 countries from the UK to South Korea to boost its textile trade.\n\nBefore heading to China, Modi travelled to Tokyo for the annual India-Japan summit, where he met the Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba. The trip takes on added weight in light of the US tariffs, as by deepening defence, technology and investment ties with Japan, India signals it can cushion the blow of lost US market access.\n\nJapanese companies are also set to invest up to \u00a510tn ($68bn) in India in the next decade, public broadcaster NHK said, as Suzuki Motor pledged to pump in about $8bn (\u00a36bn) over the next five to six years.\n\nThe two nations were partners \u201cmade for each other\u201d, Modi said this week, after visiting a Suzuki plant in India. The leaders are expected to discuss tie-ups on critical minerals and Japanese investments in high-value manufacturing in India, officials said.\n\nIndia is believed to hold substantial deposits of rare earths \u2013 used in everything from smartphones to solar panels \u2013 but lacks the technology to mine and process them extensively.\n\nWith Reuters"

    "content": "Yvette Cooper has been accused of pushing children \u201cinto the arms of people smugglers\u201d after halting a scheme allowing refugees to bring their family to the UK.\n\nThe home secretary said the refugee family reunion route was at risk of exploitation and she would temporarily suspend new applications until tougher rules were introduced next year.\n\nPeople who have had their asylum claim accepted will instead have to apply through the standard family scheme, which applies to UK citizens who have to show that they have a joint income of at least \u00a329,000 a year before they are allowed to bring a partner to the UK.\n\nKeir Starmer\u2019s government is under pressure over immigration after a summer of protests outside hotels used to house asylum seekers while their claims are being assessed.\n\nThere has been a fivefold increase in the number of refugees\u2019 family members granted visas to come to the UK, from 4,300 in 2023 to 20,600 in the year to this March.\n\nIn a statement to the Commons, Cooper said people smugglers were exploiting the family scheme to promote dangerous Channel boat crossings to potential asylum seekers.\n\n\u201cWe need to address the immediate pressures on local authorities and the risks from criminal gangs using family reunion as a pull factor to encourage more people on to boats,\u201d she told MPs.\n\n\u201cTherefore we are bringing forward new immigration rules this week to temporarily suspend new applications under the existing dedicated refugee family reunion route. Until the new framework is introduced, refugees will be covered by the same family migration rules and conditions as everyone else.\u201d\n\nEnver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cUntil now, family reunion has been one of the only safe and legal routes available that allows refugees fleeing war and persecution to be reunited with their partner and children.\n\n\u201cFar from stopping people taking dangerous journeys to cross the Channel, these changes will only push more desperate people into the arms of smugglers.\u201d\n\nCritics have accused Cooper of hypocrisy, pointing out that in 2021, Cooper told the Commons: \u201cIf there are not safe legal routes for family reunion, we end up with more people driven into the hands of dangerous criminal gangs.\u201d\n\nGunes Kalkan, the head of campaigns at the children\u2019s charity Safe Passage, said the change would have \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d for unaccompanied children trying to join their families in the UK.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about children from conflict and high human rights abuse areas, such as Afghanistan, Sudan and Iran, who have been torn apart from family in the chaos.\u201d\n\nMubeen Bhutta, the director of policy at British Red Cross, said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement will separate families and cut off one of the only safe and managed routes for children to seek protection. The vast majority of people who use family reunion visas are children and women, often trapped in very dangerous situations.\u201d\n\nCooper told MPs that six years ago refugees who applied to bring family to the UK did so on average close to 18 months after they were granted protection, allowing applicants to find work.\n\nApplications now came in on average within a month, with some councils finding that more than a quarter of their family homelessness applications were linked to refugee family reunion, she said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But she said the public wanted the asylum system to be \u201cproperly controlled and managed\u201d.\n\nThe government has committed to empty all hotels currently housing migrants by the end of the parliament, which could be as late as 2029, but the prime minister suggested on Monday he wanted to \u201cbring that forward\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, the Starmer said he understood the concerns about migration, describing them as a \u201creally serious issue\u201d.\n\nAsked to commit to a date to empty asylum hotels, he replied: \u201cWell, we\u2019ve said we\u2019ll get rid of them by the end of the parliament. I would like to bring that forward, I think it is a good challenge. I want to bring that forward.\u201d"

    "content": "An 11-year-old boy playing a common prank game of ringing doorbells in Houston, Texas, was shot dead on Saturday as he ran away from a house.\n\nAuthorities said the boy was struck several times as he and some friends were buzzing doorbells in an Eastside neighborhood.\n\nThe Houston police department have not released the identity of the boy or the occupant of the home, but said a middle-aged man has been arrested and several weapons were later recovered from the home.\n\nPolice said the boy had been playing \u201cding-dong ditch\u201d, which involves ringing on the doorbell of a home and running away. A witness saw the boy ring a doorbell and flee the property before he was struck by gunfire.\n\n\u201cA witness stated the male was running from a house, after ringing the doorbell, just prior to suffering a gunshot wound,\u201d police said in a police statement.\n\nNeighbors later told KPCR 2 that a man was seen being led in handcuffs out of a police vehicle and walking him to the home where the shooting happened.\n\nHouston homicide detective Michael Cass told CBS News affiliate KHOU that a witness had recalled someone exiting the house that was pranked and \u201cshooting at the kids running down the street\u201d.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, sadly enough, one of the boys, who was 11 years old, was shot in the back,\u201d Cass said.\n\nThe game has led to deaths before. In 2023, a California man was found guilty of murder for intentionally ramming the car of six teens who buzzed his doorbell, killing three.\n\nIn May, a man in Virginia was charged with second-degree murder after he shot and killed a teenager who had filmed a TikTok video playing the doorbell game on the man\u2019s home at 3am, according to local police reports."

    "content": "Victims of sexual crimes and #MeToo harassment have, on multiple fronts, seen setbacks in the US in recent months.\n\nThe movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is now looking at a third trial on sexual assault charges after previous cases delivered mixed results for his victims. A high-profile case of federal racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking against the rapper Sean Combs returned a verdict only on lesser charges.\n\nAt the same time, some men accused of sexual misconduct or harassment have made their way back toward the spotlight \u2013 Donald Trump is in the White House, comedian Louis CK is headlining a national tour, and former New York governor Andrew Cuomo is running for New York City mayor.\n\nFor Kaja Sokola, Weinstein\u2019s youngest sexual assault accuser, it is a tough moment to speak out as a victim.\n\n\u201cI believe they are a setback for #MeToo, and I believe that it is very important right now for people to speak out,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cFor people that are being abused, the most important message I can send is that you don\u2019t have to go to court to get justice \u2013 but you need to talk to other people.\u201d\n\nSokola knows about disappointment in the face of US justice. She says Weinstein raped her twice, in 2002 when she was 16, and in 2006 when she was 19. At trial in June, Sokola, now 39, testified about the alleged 2006 rape. Sokola testified that she had gone with her older sister to a meeting with Weinstein when he took her to hotel and raped her.\n\nThe jury found that the charge relating to Sokola\u2019s claim had not met the burden of proof required for conviction. But the jury found Weinstein guilty of raping accuser Miriam Haley and were hung on a charge relating to accuser Jessica Mann \u2013 the charge that may now be retried.\n\nAfter Weinstein was found not guilty on the Sokola charge in June, Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg apologized to Sokola for the verdict and thanked her for her bravery.\n\n\u201cWithout the courage of survivors like you, prosecutors like us cannot pursue accountability and justice,\u201d he said. He added that the case was \u201cabout an immense power imbalance\u201d.\n\nSokola has had time to consider the events of that time. Her sister had turned over to the defense personal writings from a spell in rehab when Sokola was treated for alcoholism and bulimia that did not mention the alleged Weinstein rape among a list of men that had abused her. The sisters are not on speaking terms. \u201cNo, and I will not [speak to her],\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was terrified that Harvey\u2019s lawyers could crush me, so that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t write about it.\u201d A former friend had also testified that Sokola and Weinstein had been together earlier, throwing off the timeline of her account.\n\n\u201cThe trial, from what I understand, was more about proving the point that people who thought they were untouchable are not untouchable,\u201d Sokola said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that I came forward for people to hear my story, and prosecutors decided that it was a case. The jurors are a whole different story.\u201d\n\nShe said she identifies with Cassie Ventura, who testified at length in the Sean Combs case. Sokola too had been in a long, abusive relationship. In Sokola\u2019s case, that became a custody battle with her husband of seven years that a US court found had subjected her to \u201csevere, unrelenting psychological and physical abuse\u201d.\n\n\u201cI really connected with Cassie\u2019s story, because I think people don\u2019t really understand right now how difficult it is to step out of a relationship that\u2019s abusive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have so much empathy for Cassie. I met Harvey when I was 16; she met Sean when she was 19. We were just kids.\u201d\n\nThe picture Sokola paints of young women like her coming to the US at the time is in keeping with stories of that era in the 2000s. The fashion industry wanted to cast eastern European and Brazilian models, and model agencies readily delivered.\n\n\u201cI was definitely the type for that. But I think sending a 16-year-old to cities like this is inappropriate.\u201d\n\nWhat she found was not necessarily what she anticipated. Models would be encouraged to go nightclubs by promoters who were often also models. Two New York nightclubs of the time, Seraphina and Butter, were mentioned at trial.\n\n\u201cEveryone knew about what was going on. It was not a secret. The first time I went out for dinner, at Seraphina, I was like, \u2018Oh my God, someone is paying for my dinner. They\u2019re so generous. How lucky!\u2019 It was only later that I understood the trade and I changed my perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe [modelling] agencies are like pimps for rich people,\u201d Sokola now considers.\n\nWeinstein, who denies the allegations against him, is currently in jail on Rikers Island in New York, and faces sentencing on 30 September on the Miriam Haley conviction, which could add 10 years to the 16-year sentence he received from a separate sexual assault conviction in California. But the New York sentencing will only happen if there is no retrial on the Jessica Mann rape charge.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s defense team told the Guardian their client is not willing to plead guilty to raping Mann to avoid a fourth trial.\n\n\u201cAt some point this becomes a little too much,\u201d said Weinstein crisis PR Juda Engelmayer. \u201cThe prosecution had a hard time making their case last time, and they\u2019ll have a hard time the next time around. Harvey is more than ready for his next day in court.\u201d\n\nBut Sokola\u2019s part is done \u2013 she can\u2019t be called again to tell her story in court. And she has come to terms with that.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably going to die in jail. I\u2019m not 16 any more. I\u2019m 39, and I can stand my own ground. I think I\u2019m good with whatever it is right now. It was like the closing of a chapter.\u201d"

    "content": "Victims of sexual crimes and #MeToo harassment have, on multiple fronts, seen setbacks in the US in recent months.\n\nThe movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is now looking at a third trial on sexual assault charges after previous cases delivered mixed results for his victims. A high-profile case of federal racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking against the rapper Sean Combs returned a verdict only on lesser charges.\n\nAt the same time, some men accused of sexual misconduct or harassment have made their way back toward the spotlight \u2013 Donald Trump is in the White House, comedian Louis CK is headlining a national tour, and former New York governor Andrew Cuomo is running for New York City mayor.\n\nFor Kaja Sokola, Weinstein\u2019s youngest sexual assault accuser, it is a tough moment to speak out as a victim.\n\n\u201cI believe they are a setback for #MeToo, and I believe that it is very important right now for people to speak out,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cFor people that are being abused, the most important message I can send is that you don\u2019t have to go to court to get justice \u2013 but you need to talk to other people.\u201d\n\nSokola knows about disappointment in the face of US justice. She says Weinstein raped her twice, in 2002 when she was 16, and in 2006 when she was 19. At trial in June, Sokola, now 39, testified about the alleged 2006 rape. Sokola testified that she had gone with her older sister to a meeting with Weinstein when he took her to hotel and raped her.\n\nThe jury found that the charge relating to Sokola\u2019s claim had not met the burden of proof required for conviction. But the jury found Weinstein guilty of raping accuser Miriam Haley and were hung on a charge relating to accuser Jessica Mann \u2013 the charge that may now be retried.\n\nAfter Weinstein was found not guilty on the Sokola charge in June, Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg apologized to Sokola for the verdict and thanked her for her bravery.\n\n\u201cWithout the courage of survivors like you, prosecutors like us cannot pursue accountability and justice,\u201d he said.

The national NPR and PBS networks are reducing expected dues payments, and a philanthropic effort focused on the hardest-hit stations is taking shape.

It's a small community growing fast with an influx of retirees, many who depend on the station's news to learn about their new home, said general manager Kevin Crane.\n\nWith $525,000 gone from its budget, Hawaii Public Radio has already raised $650,000 in an emergency fund drive. \"It's a validation that what you're doing is essential to the community and is appreciated by the community,\" said Meredith Artley, president and CEO.

Both PBS and NPR have taken steps to reduce the annual dues that stations pay for programming and other services. At PBS, it's an average 15% reduction, but needy stations get more \u2014 in one case, more than half of next year's dues will be forgiven, said PBS president Paula Kerger.\n\nAdopting stations in poorer, more rural areas\n\nNPR is encouraging donors in wealthier areas to adopt stations in poorer ones, perhaps in an area where a contributor has emotional ties.\n\nNational Public Radio President and CEO Katherine Maher told CBS News in July that \"defunding this is a real risk to the public safety of the country.\"\n\n\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters.\n\nPublic media leaders are also working with a group of philanthropists led by the Knight and MacArthur foundations that is hoping to raise some $50 million to support stations in areas hardest hit be the cuts. Ed Ulman, president and CEO of Alaska Public Media, which represents nearly two dozen radio and television stations in the largest state, said he'll be seeking money from this fund.\n\nUlman said he's been buoyed by the response from Alaskans in their effort to raise $15 million through various sources by October. The services their stations provide is free, and citizens see its value.\n\n\"I've never been worried about the future of public television or radio because our community needs us,\" he said, \"and what we've seen in Alaska is an outcry about that.\"\n\nStill, Alaska Public Media has suspended the weekly public affairs television show \"Alaska Insight,\" which isn't returning after a summer hiatus.

Preliminary reports found that the assault occurred while the woman was at a resort on Paradise Island. Officers later arrested a 28-year-old man in connection with the incident.\n\nShortly after 6:30 p.m. on Aug. 31, officers responded to a crash involving a jet ski in the waters off Paradise Island, according to a news release.

Medical staff treated their injuries on scene, but both men declined further medical treatment at the hospital.\n\nSecurity issues in the Bahamas\n\nIn April, the U.S. Embassy in Nassau issued a security alert advising U.S. citizens about the risks of renting jet skis in the Bahamas.

    "content": "A man died in the Bahamas on Sunday after a boating accident at sea, prompting police to investigate.\n\nThe incident occurred after 11:30 a.m. local time when officers from the Marine Support Services Branch responded to a collision involving a vessel and a jet ski in waters off of Paradise Island, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said in a news release.\n\nThe male rider of the jet ski was found unresponsive and had visible injuries, police said.\n\n\"Medical personnel visited the scene, examined the victim but found no vital signs of life,\" the release said.\n\nPolice said the investigation is continuing.\n\nMeanwhile, police are also investigating other incidents involving Americans in or near Paradise Island.\n\nShortly before 4:40 a.m. Monday, a female victim identified as a U.S. national was allegedly sexually assaulted while at a resort on Paradise Island, according to a news release from police. Preliminary reports found that the assault occurred while the woman was at a resort on Paradise Island. Officers later arrested a 28-year-old man in connection with the incident.\n\nShortly after 6:30 p.m. on Aug. 31, officers responded to a crash involving a jet ski in the waters off Paradise Island, according to a news release. Preliminary reports indicate that two men from the U.S., aged 42 and 29, were riding the jet ski when it lost control and hit a dock near a resort. Medical staff treated their injuries on scene, but both men declined further medical treatment at the hospital.\n\nSecurity issues in the Bahamas\n\nIn April, the U.S. Embassy in Nassau issued a security alert advising U.S. citizens about the risks of renting jet skis in the Bahamas. According to the alert, \"Nassau jet ski operators have raped and sexually assaulted U.S. citizen women.\"\n\nWomen who say they were victimized also reported that male jet ski operators picked them up from downtown Nassau and Paradise Island beaches, including the area from Junkanoo Beach to Saunders Beach and Cabbage Beach.\n\n\"Due to security risks, U.S. government employees working in the Bahamas are prohibited from renting and using jet skis on New Providence and Paradise Islands,\" the alert read.\n\nThe alert urged people to take the following actions to be safe: avoid renting jet skis in the Bahamas, be aware of your surroundings, stay alert in public restrooms near Nassau beaches and always follow local weather and marine alerts."

The Committee has withdrawn its subpoena,\" the aide said in a statement.\n\nMueller, who led the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and delivered the long-anticipated report in March 2019, served as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 12 years. The New York Times reported Sunday that the 81-year-old has Parkinson's disease, according to his family, who told the paper that he was diagnosed in 2021.\n\nFormer Special Counsel Robert Mueller makes an opening statement before testifying to the House Judiciary Committee about his report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election in the Rayburn House Office Building July 24, 2019 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images\n\nThe committee issued the subpoena to Mueller last month amid a slew of subpoenas seeking depositions from former Justice Department officials, among others. Mueller served as FBI director from 2001 to 2013.\n\n\"Because you were FBI Director during the time when Mr. Epstein was under investigation by the FBI, the Committee believes that you possess knowledge and information relevant to its investigation,\" committee chairman James Comer wrote in an Aug. 5 letter to Mueller, directing him to appear for deposition on Sept. 2.\n\nThe development comes as controversy has swirled around the Epstein files in recent months, following the Justice Department's issuing of the findings of an internal review, which found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. But the issue has spurred calls for greater transparency, while dividing President Trump's base.\n\nLate last month, the administration released transcripts of a two-day interview with Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. And the House Oversight Committee plans to make some files it received from the DOJ related to Epstein public after redactions have been made."

    "content": "A federal judge on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from sending any unaccompanied migrant child to Guatemala unless they have a deportation order, just hours after lawyers alerted her of what they described as a hurried government effort to deport hundreds of children.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Sparkle Sooknanan issued her order as the deportation effort was fully underway, with planes with migrant children on board ready to take off from Texas.\n\nEarlier Sunday, in the overnight hours, Sooknanan issued a temporary restraining order barring officials from sending a group of 10 migrant children between the ages of 10 and 17 to Guatemala, granting a request from attorneys who alleged the effort would skirt legal protections Congress established for these minors. She also scheduled a hearing in the afternoon to weigh the case's next steps.\n\nBut Sooknanan abruptly moved up the hearing earlier on Sunday, saying she had been alerted that some migrant children were already in the process of being deported.\n\nAs that hearing got underway, Sooknanan announced she had just issued a broader temporary restraining order blocking any deportations of unaccompanied children from Guatemala and in U.S. custody who did not have a deportation order. She instructed Drew Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer representing the Trump administration, to quickly inform officials they had to halt their deportation plans.\n\nEnsign acknowledged deportation planes had been prepared to take off on Sunday, but said they were all \"on the ground\" and still on U.S. soil. He said he believed one plane had taken off earlier but had come back.\n\nAt the request of Sooknanan, Ensign said he confirmed that the children on the planes would be deplaned and returned to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for caring for migrant minors who enter the U.S. without authorization and without their parents or legal guardians.\n\nThe Justice Department said 76 unaccompanied children were slated to be sent to Guatemala on Sunday before the effort was blocked. Of those, 16 had been returned to HHS custody as of Sunday evening and the rest were expected to be in HHS care by 10:30 p.m.\n\nHHS houses unaccompanied children in shelters or foster homes until they turn 18 or until they can be placed with a suitable sponsor in the U.S., who are often family members.\n\nSooknanan conceded her temporary restraining order, which is set to last 14 days, is \"extraordinary\" but justified it on the grounds that the government had decided to \"execute a plan to remove these children\" in the \"wee hours\" of a holiday weekend.\n\nIn their lawsuit, lawyers for the group of Guatemalan children said the Trump administration had launched an effort to deport more than 600 migrant minors to Guatemala without allowing them to request humanitarian protection, even though U.S. law protects them from speedy deportations. They alleged the children could face abuse, neglect or persecution if returned to Guatemala.\n\nEnsign, the Justice Department attorney, said the Trump administration was not trying to formally deport the Guatemalan children under U.S. immigration law, but instead repatriate them to Guatemala so they could reunite with relatives there. He said the Guatemalan government and the children's relatives had requested the reunifications.\n\nBut lawyers for the children disputed the government's claims, citing one case in which they say a child's parents did not request any repatriation. They also said a law known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act says unaccompanied migrant children who are not from Mexico must be allowed to see an immigration judge and apply for legal protections before any deportation effort. Some of the children facing return to Guatemala still have pending immigration cases, the attorneys said.\n\nEnsign said the government's legal position is that it can \"repatriate\" these children, based on an authority given to HHS to reunite \"unaccompanied alien children with a parent abroad in appropriate cases.\"\n\nRepresentatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the deportation plans.\n\nNeha Desai, an attorney at the California-based National Center for Youth Law who works with migrant minors, said the U.S. government was attempting to deport children with \"already filed claims for legal relief based on the abuse and persecution that they experienced in their home country.\"\n\n\"This is both unlawful and profoundly inhumane,\" Desai added.\n\nMost of the unaccompanied children who cross the U.S. southern border without legal permission hail from Central America and tend to be teenagers. Once in the U.S., many file applications for asylum or other immigration benefits to try to stay in the country legally, such as a visa for abused, abandoned or neglected youth.\n\nAs part of its larger crackdown on illegal immigration, the Trump administration has sought to make drastic changes to how the U.S. processes unaccompanied children. It has made it harder for some relatives, including those in the country illegally, to sponsor unaccompanied children out of government custody and offered some teenagers the option to voluntary return to their native countries.\n\nThe Trump administration has also directed agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies to conduct \"welfare checks\" on children released from HHS custody, a move it has said is in response to disputed claims that the Biden administration \"lost\" hundreds of thousands of migrant minors.\n\nThere are currently roughly 2,000 migrant children in HHS care."

    "content": "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told CBS News the Trump administration has not communicated with his state on a reported plan to send military forces to Chicago, calling the idea an \"invasion\" and arguing President Trump has \"other aims\" aside from cracking down on crime.\n\nAsked about a possible military deployment to America's third-largest city, which was recently reported by The Washington Post, Pritzker told CBS News: \"It's clear that, in secret, they're planning this \u2014 well, it's an invasion with U.S. troops, if they, in fact, do that.\"\n\nMr. Trump has deployed National Guard forces and federal agents to the streets of two other major cities \u2014 Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. \u2014 in recent months, part of what the president casts as a crackdown against illegal immigration, violent crime and civil unrest.\n\nLast week, the president said his administration could take similar steps in Chicago. Mr. Trump called the city a \"mess\" and lashed out against Mayor Brandon Johnson, saying, \"We'll straighten that one out probably next.\"\n\nMr. Trump is planning major immigration enforcement operations in Chicago that could start as soon as next week, echoing a similar operation in Los Angeles, sources told CBS News. And The Washington Post has reported that the Pentagon is drawing up plans to potentially send thousands of National Guard members to the Midwest's largest metro area as early as September \u2014 though those plans haven't been publicly confirmed.\n\nPritzker told CBS News that, if Mr. Trump sends the Guard to Chicago, voters \"should understand that he has other aims, other than fighting crime.\"\n\nThe governor argued that the president's gambit may be part of a plan to \"stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.\"\n\nHe also called the idea \"an attack on the American people.\"\n\n\"Now, he may disagree with a state that didn't vote for him. But, should he be sending troops in? No,\" Pritzker said in an interview with CBS News in Chicago.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson rejected Pritzker's accusations and blasted the city's violent crime rate.\n\n\"It's amazing the lengths this slob will go to in order to deflect from the terrible crime crisis that has been plaguing Chicago for years,\" Jackson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Chicago's residents would be much safer if Pritzker actually did his job and addressed his crime problem instead of trying to be a Resistance Lib hero.\"\n\nIn a Truth Social post Saturday evening, Mr. Trump called Pritzker a \"weak and pathetic Governor\" who \"just said that he doesn't need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we're coming!\"\n\nOn Friday, Pritzker, asked whether he was suggesting that the president is an authoritarian, pointed to Germany's history. He noted that he built a Holocaust museum and knows \"what the history was of a constitutional republic being overturned, after an election, in 53 days.\" Pritzker added that he's \"very, very concerned.\"\n\n\"We could talk about lots of authoritarian regimes in the world, but that just happens to be the one that I know,\" Pritzker said. \"And I can tell you that- that the playbook is the same: It's thwart the media, it's create mayhem that requires military interdiction. These are things that happen throughout history, and Donald Trump is just following that playbook.\"\n\nThe Illinois governor said that he plans to \"do everything I can to stop him from taking away people's rights and from using the military to invade states,\" referencing Mr. Trump. He added that it's \"very important for us all to stand up.\"\n\nThe Guard deployments in Los Angeles and D.C. have drawn stiff pushback from elected officials who argue local police are better able to handle crime, and warn the presence of federal agents and military personnel could inflame tensions.\n\nFuture military deployments could also draw legal challenges. While Mr. Trump controls the D.C. National Guard outright, the governors of the 50 states typically control their own Guard forces except in certain circumstances.\n\nThe Trump administration deployed thousands of California National Guard members to Los Angeles over Gov. Gavin Newsom's objections in June, arguing they were necessary to protect federal immigration agents and facilities from tense protests in the city.\n\nThe state of California sued the administration, calling the deployment illegal. An appeals court found that Mr. Trump likely did have the legal authority to call up the state's National Guard, under a law that lets the president call Guard forces into federal service during a \"rebellion\" or if he isn't able to \"execute the laws of the United States.\" A lower court is still reviewing whether military forces in Los Angeles were inappropriately used for law enforcement purposes.\n\ncontributed to this report."
